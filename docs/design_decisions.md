# Design decisions and defensible citations

Living notes to seed the paper's Methods section. Each entry records a
decision we've made in `ssign`, the scientific rationale, and the
peer-reviewed citations that back it. When paper-writing starts, pull
from here directly.

Entries are organised by pipeline stage. Each has three parts:

- **Decision** — what we do
- **Rationale / evidence** — why, with peer-reviewed citations
- **Methods-section draft** — drop-in paragraph (edit as needed)

## 1. CDS calling

### 1.1 Sole canonical CDS caller: Bakta (via Pyrodigal)

- **Decision:** `ssign` uses Bakta as its sole canonical CDS caller. Bakta
  internally wraps Pyrodigal (a maintained Cython rebinding of
  Prodigal v2.6.3+31b300a) and adds a custom small-ORF (<30 aa) detector.
  No consensus across multiple CDS predictors is performed.

- **Rationale:**
  - **Pyrodigal ≡ Prodigal, but maintained.** Pyrodigal is a
    regression-tested rebinding of Prodigal v2.6.3, not a
    reimplementation. Pyrodigal is actively released
    (v3.7.1, March 2026) while the original Prodigal binary has been
    near-dormant since 2016 — Pyrodigal is the responsible choice for a
    5-year reproducibility target.
  - **Prodigal's accuracy on Gram-negatives is well-characterised.**
    On _E. coli_ K-12 with experimentally verified genes: 100%
    sensitivity on the verified set, 96.5% correct start-site
    identification (Hyatt et al., 2010). In the 15-tool ORForise
    benchmark, Prodigal ranked 1st overall across 12 metrics on 3/6
    model organisms including three Gram-negatives (Dimonaco et al.,
    2022).
  - **Multi-caller consensus has been shown to hurt in this regime.**
    Dimonaco et al. (2022) explicitly tested the union of the five
    best callers across seven organisms and found it improved gene
    detection by only **0.47% on average while substantially increasing
    false-positive CDS**. Their recommendation: "we advise against
    generating aggregated ab initio annotations from multiple tools
    where no existing annotation is available for the genome, as this
    results in poor overall performance."
  - **Inter-tool disagreement is almost entirely start-codon
    placement, not gene presence.** Korandla et al. (2020) (AssessORF)
    showed 88–95% of CDS calls agree between top-tier predictors with
    no clear winner; disagreements are dominated by start-codon choice
    within otherwise-concordant ORFs. Small N-terminal shifts do not
    affect secretion-substrate identification because downstream HMM,
    signal-peptide, and proximity analyses are robust to a few-residue
    start-site difference.
  - **No license-clean alternative adds independent signal.** Prokka
    (Seemann, 2014) wraps the same Prodigal; its author has publicly
    endorsed Bakta as the successor. PGAP (NCBI) bundles GeneMarkS-2+
    under a Georgia Tech non-redistribution clause, making it
    incompatible with a public SHA-pinned Docker image. GeneMarkS-2
    standalone has the same license problem. Pyrodigal-gv is
    giant-virus-tuned, not bacterial.
  - **ML-based CDS callers are not production-ready for a 2031
    reproducibility target.** BALROG (Sommer & Salzberg, 2021) gives
    ~11% false-positive reduction at 100× runtime, but its GitHub
    repository shows near-total maintenance abandonment since early
    2023 (zero releases, unanswered issues, first author moved on).
    Recent protein-language-model pipelines (Bacformer,
    Protein Set Transformer) _consume_ Pyrodigal output rather than
    replacing it — a strong signal that the field still regards
    Prodigal-class callers as canonical.

### 1.2 Re-annotate by default (Phase 3.3)

- **Decision:** When the input is a GenBank file, `ssign` re-runs Bakta
  on the DNA sequences by default and treats Bakta's fresh CDS set as
  canonical. The user's original GenBank annotations are preserved as
  a separate `gbff_annotation` column (mapped to Bakta's CDS by
  reciprocal coordinate overlap) and vote independently in
  annotation-consensus. Users with curated GenBanks can skip the Bakta
  re-run via `--use-input-annotations`.

- **Rationale:** Incoming GenBanks have untrusted provenance — they
  may come from old Prokka runs, private pipelines, manual curation,
  or RefSeq at any vintage. Uniform Bakta re-annotation across a
  cohort is required for reproducible consensus voting; without it,
  "Bakta said X, EggNOG said Y, GBFF said Z" is unsound because the
  three opinions might concern slightly different CDS.

- **Citations:** as above (Bakta, Pyrodigal).

## 2. Secretion-system detection

### 2.1 MacSyFinder v2 + TXSScan

- **Decision:** Secretion systems are detected using MacSyFinder v2
  with the TXSScan HMM profile models. Only systems with a
  `wholeness_score ≥ 0.8` are accepted as valid. Flagellum, Tad, and
  T3SS are excluded from substrate identification by default.

- **Rationale:**
  - MacSyFinder v2 is the current community standard for
    secretion-system detection, a full rewrite of the original tool
    focused on better edge-case handling and bundled profile packaging.
  - TXSScan provides curated HMM profiles for T1SS–T6SS plus flagellar
    and Tad-pilus systems.
  - **`wholeness_score ≥ 0.8` threshold**: Systems below 0.8 lack too
    many essential components to be confidently called. The threshold
    matches TXSScan's recommended quorum for Gram-negative genomes.
  - **Excluded systems (default):**
    - _Flagellum:_ not a secretion system in the substrate-export
      sense; its components are not secretion machinery for proteins
      to be functionally secreted. Including it pollutes substrate
      lists with flagellar proteins.
    - _Tad pilus:_ similar reasoning — its cargo is structural, not
      secreted effectors.
    - _T3SS:_ excluded due to the DeepSecE-DSE reliability issue
      documented below (§3.3).

- **Citations:**
  - [Neron et al. (2023). _Peer Community Journal_ 3:e28](https://doi.org/10.24072/pcjournal.250) — MacSyFinder v2.
  - [Abby et al. (2016). _Scientific Reports_ 6:23080](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep23080) — TXSScan.

## 3. Secreted-protein prediction

### 3.1 Equal-predictor rule: DLP / DSE / PLM-E all trigger

- **Decision (Phase 3.2.b):** DeepLocPro, DeepSecE, and PLM-Effector
  are treated as **equal secretion predictors**. A protein is marked
  as a candidate substrate if **any one** of these three flags
  secretion. The count of agreeing tools is recorded as
  `n_prediction_tools_agreeing` (0-3) as a confidence signal, and
  `secretion_evidence` lists which tools flagged.

- **Rationale:**
  - **DLP** (localisation-based, trained on ~40k bacterial proteins)
    and **DSE** (secretion-type, trained on secretion-system
    effectors) measure different biological signals. A protein can be
    clearly secreted by cellular localisation without being a known
    effector, and vice versa — treating them as equal predictors
    captures both views.
  - **PLM-E** adds a third independent signal based on
    protein-language-model ensemble classification
    (ESM-1b + ESM-2 + ProtT5 + XGBoost stacking per SS type).
  - **Equality with OR-logic** is the current best practice for
    secretion prediction, where false negatives from any single tool
    are expensive (missed substrates) and false positives get filtered
    by downstream proximity analysis.

- **Citations:**
  - [Moreno et al. (2024). _Bioinformatics_ 40(12):btae677](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btae677) — DeepLocPro.
  - [Zhang et al. (2023). _Research_ 6:0258](https://doi.org/10.34133/research.0258) — DeepSecE.
  - [Zheng (2026). _Briefings in Bioinformatics_ 27(2):bbag143](https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbag143) — PLM-Effector.

### 3.2 SignalP is evidence-only, not a trigger

- **Decision (Phase 3.2.b):** SignalP is recorded as a separate
  `signalp_supports_secretion` column but does **not** contribute to
  `is_secreted` or `n_prediction_tools_agreeing`.

- **Rationale:** SignalP detects **Sec/Tat signal peptides**, which
  cover only a subset of secretion pathways. Many Gram-negative
  effectors (T3SS, T4SS, T6SS, T1SS C-terminal signals) lack classical
  signal peptides, so SignalP correctly reports "no signal peptide"
  for them. Treating SignalP as a trigger would under-call these
  effector classes. Keeping it as evidence preserves its information
  value without biasing the secretion call.

- **Citations:**
  - [Teufel et al. (2022). _Nature Biotechnology_ 40(7):1023–1025](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01156-3) — SignalP 6.0.

### 3.3 T3SS excluded by default (DeepSecE reliability guard)

- **Decision:** T3SS predictions from DeepSecE are flagged
  (`dse_T3SS_flagged=True`) and excluded from the trigger count
  unless MacSyFinder independently validates a T3SS in the same
  genome. Additionally, T3SS appears in `excluded_systems` by
  default, so T3SS-associated substrates are dropped from the
  default output.

- **Rationale (internal benchmark):** In a 74-genome _Xanthomonas_
  benchmark, MacSyFinder found **0 T3SS systems** while DeepSecE
  predicted **1,808 T3SS substrate candidates** across the same
  cohort — mostly hypothetical proteins and flagellar-protein
  misclassifications. This false-positive rate is too high to accept
  uncritically; gating DSE T3SS calls on MacSyFinder validation
  prevents large-scale over-calling. The reliability issue is T3SS-
  specific; DSE calls for T1SS/T2SS/T4SS/T6SS are not gated.

- **Note for paper:** The 74-genome benchmark is internal. Either
  include these numbers as supplementary data (lab-generated,
  citable as Reid et al., in preparation), or replicate on a
  published _Xanthomonas_ set before submission.

### 3.4 Why PLM-Effector is vendored

- **Decision:** PLM-Effector source code is vendored into
  `src/ssign_app/scripts/plm_effector/` rather than installed as a
  dependency.

- **Rationale:**
  - No PyPI package exists upstream; install is conda-based with
    Python 3.9 + CUDA 11.3 pinned, which conflicts with `ssign`'s
    Python 3.10+ baseline.
  - Upstream code has hardcoded paths to the author's institutional
    machine (`/home/zhengdd/...`) that require edits to run anywhere
    else.
  - Vendoring lets us adapt for Python 3.10+, wrap a clean CLI around
    the entry point, and ship a SHA-pinned Docker image with 5-year
    reproducibility.
  - License: CC-BY 3.0 (not MIT, despite the upstream README badge
    claiming MIT; the actual `LICENSE` file is CC-BY 3.0). CC-BY 3.0
    explicitly permits redistribution with attribution, which we
    preserve via `src/ssign_app/scripts/plm_effector/LICENSE` and a
    citation entry in `CITATION.cff`.

## 4. Annotation consensus

### 4.1 17-category broad functional voting

- **Decision:** Each substrate protein is classified into one of 17
  broad functional categories (Adhesin, Autotransporter, Protease,
  Lipase/Esterase, Nuclease, Glycoside hydrolase, Toxin, Transporter,
  Secretion system, Flagellar, Oxidoreductase, Transferase, Chaperone,
  Binding protein, Structural, Regulatory, Hypothetical) by keyword-
  matching tool-specific description strings. Multiple tools vote;
  the most-supported category becomes `broad_annotation`, with tool
  names listed as evidence.

- **Rationale:**
  - 17 categories is a pragmatic compromise between "too broad to be
    useful" (4-5 COG-style superclasses) and "too granular to vote"
    (hundreds of KEGG/GO terms). Keyword matching against descriptions
    is tool-agnostic: any new tool that produces a human-readable
    description string can contribute votes without a schema change.
  - Confidence tiers (High ≥3 tools, Medium =2, Low =1, None =0)
    provide a simple interpretable confidence signal that maps
    directly to the `confidence_tier` column in the final output.

- **Tools voting (8 sources):** Bakta product, EggNOG description,
  BLASTp top hit description, HH-suite top Pfam description, HH-suite
  top PDB description, InterProScan descriptions, pLM-BLAST top ECOD
  hit, original GenBank annotation (GBFF). SignalP is excluded from
  annotation voting because it's a prediction tool, not an
  annotation tool.

### 4.2 Cross-tool field naming

- **Decision:** Bakta and EggNOG output tables use unified field names
  for cross-referenced codes: `ec_numbers`, `cog_ids`, `go_terms`,
  `kegg_ko` (not `kegg_ids`), `pfam_ids`.

- **Rationale:** Both EggNOG's `KEGG_ko` column and Bakta's
  `DbXrefs:KEGG:...` entries carry KEGG Orthology IDs. Using a single
  name (`kegg_ko`) across tools means `annotation_consensus.py` does
  not need per-tool column-name conditionals.

---

## 5. Proximity analysis

### 5.1 Per-SS-component window, not full system span

- **Decision:** Neighborhood proteins are defined as ±3 genes from
  **each individual SS component's gene**, taking the union — not ±3
  from the full system-wide span.

- **Rationale:** Using the system-wide span caused ~26 false positive
  substrates in early benchmarking (internal). SS components can be
  scattered across tens of kb (e.g. T1SS genes split into an operon
  plus an outer-membrane channel located elsewhere), so a "full span"
  window pulls in unrelated neighbouring genes. Per-component ±3 is
  biologically grounded: most T1SS/T4SS substrates are encoded
  immediately adjacent to one of the component genes.

- **Cross-contig guard:** Proximity windows never cross contig
  boundaries. For fragmented assemblies this prevents proteins on
  different contigs from appearing as "neighbours" of an SS component.

---

## 6. Pipeline architecture decisions

### 6.1 Offline-first

- **Decision:** `ssign` v1.0.0 has no external API dependencies. All
  tools run from local binaries and databases; no remote calls.

- **Rationale:** Publication longevity. External services (NCBI remote
  BLAST, EBI InterProScan web, MPI Toolkit HHpred, BioLib-hosted DTU
  tools) get deprecated, rate-limited, or altered over a 5-10 year
  window. A local-only pipeline is the only architecture that can
  reliably reproduce a 2026 analysis in 2031.

### 6.2 Install tiers (base / extended / full)

- **Decision:** Three install tiers differ in which databases
  `scripts/fetch_databases.sh` downloads:
  - **base** (~17 GB): MacSyFinder + DLP + DSE + SignalP + PLM-E +
    Bakta light
  - **extended** (~130 GB): + EggNOG + HH-suite (Pfam + PDB70) +
    InterProScan + pLM-BLAST
  - **full** (~630 GB): + BLAST NR + Bakta full DB + HH-suite UniRef30

- **Rationale:** Lab researchers rarely need BLAST NR (390 GB). Tier-
  aware distribution keeps the minimum-useful install under 20 GB
  while still offering the full reproducibility bundle for users who
  need it.

### 6.3 Nextflow "power mode" deprecated

- **Decision:** The Nextflow DSL2 pipeline (`bin/`, `modules/local/`,
  `workflows/`, `main.nf`, `nextflow.config`) is being removed for
  v1.0.0. The Python `ssign run` CLI + Singularity covers all HPC
  batch use cases.

- **Rationale:** Maintaining two orchestrators (Python runner +
  Nextflow) forced double-bookkeeping of every script between `bin/`
  and `src/ssign_app/scripts/`. Migration guidance for Nextflow-users
  will be in `docs/how-to/run_on_hpc.md`.

---

## 7. License and distribution

### 7.1 GPL-3.0-or-later

- **Decision:** `ssign` is distributed under GPL-3.0-or-later.

- **Rationale:** The binding constraint is Pyrodigal (imported
  directly in `extract_proteins.py:157`), which is GPL-3. All other
  direct dependencies (biopython, pandas, numpy, streamlit, pyhmmer)
  are permissive (BSD/MIT/Apache) and compatible with GPL-3.
  Switching to Apache 2.0 or MIT would require replacing
  `import pyrodigal` with a subprocess `prodigal` call — not worth the
  engineering for a public research tool where GPL-3 is standard.

---

## 8. Reference fixture genome

- **Decision:** Regression and integration tests use `contig_87` of
  _Xanthobacter tagetidis_ ATCC 700314 (213 kb, 179 CDS). BIMENO_04457
  on this contig is the expected T1SS substrate.

- **Rationale:** T1SS is Teo's research focus. The source assembly is
  fragmented (87 contigs); contig_87 was chosen because it contains
  the full T1SS operon plus the substrate on a single contiguous DNA
  span. The whole contig fits inside 213 kb, which is a reasonable
  git-tracked fixture size.
