# Licensing — ssign Dependencies & Redistribution

This page documents the redistribution status of every external tool, model,
and database ssign uses. The audits below answer the question
**"Can the ssign Docker image bundle this, or must the user download it
themselves?"** for each component.

ssign itself is **GPL-3.0-or-later** (see `LICENSE`). Every dependency listed
here is compatible with GPL-3.0 redistribution at the level of the ssign
package; the per-component questions below are about whether **ssign's
Docker image** can include the binary/weight/database file inside it, vs.
require the user to fetch it after pulling.

| Component | License | In ssign Docker image? | If not bundled, fetch via |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DeepSecE checkpoint** | (vendored, MIT) | ✅ Bundled (mirrored to Zenodo) | — |
| **PLM-Effector weights** | MIT | ✅ Bundled (mirrored to Zenodo) | — |
| **ProtT5 weights** (Rostlab/prot_t5_xl_uniref50) | AFL-3.0 | ✅ Bundled (mirrored to Zenodo) | — |
| **SignalP 6.0** (binary + weights) | DTU academic | ⏳ Pending DTU response | DTU portal (manual) |
| **DeepLocPro** (binary + weights) | DTU academic | ⏳ Pending DTU response | DTU portal (manual) |
| **EggNOG database** | unspecified | ⏳ Pending EMBL response | `download_eggnog_data.py` |
| **InterProScan tarball + member DBs** | Apache 2.0 (core) + mixed (members) | ❌ Not bundled | `scripts/fetch_databases.sh` |
| **BLAST NR / Swiss-Prot** | NCBI public | ❌ Not bundled (size) | `scripts/fetch_databases.sh` |
| **Bakta DB** | CC-BY 4.0 | ❌ Not bundled (size) | `bakta_db download` |
| **HH-suite Pfam / PDB70 / UniRef30** | mixed (Söding lab + Tübingen) | ❌ Not bundled (size) | `scripts/fetch_databases.sh` |
| **TXSScan models** | CECILL | Bundled with MacSyFinder install | — |

## ProtT5 weights — ✅ MIRROR + BUNDLE OK

Used by PLM-Effector and pLM-BLAST. Released under the **Academic Free License
3.0** (AFL-3.0), an OSI-approved permissive license.

> "The ProtTrans pretrained models are released under the terms of the
> Academic Free License v3.0 License."
> — [ProtTrans README](https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans)

AFL-3.0 explicitly grants public redistribution. No non-commercial or
field-of-use restriction. Compatible with ssign's GPL-3.0. Ship with the
AFL-3.0 license text and a citation pointer to Elnaggar et al. 2022 (TPAMI).
ColabFold and bio_embeddings already redistribute these weights in their
Docker images — established precedent.

**Action:** mirror to ssign's Zenodo deposit + bake into the v1.0.0 Docker
image.

## InterProScan — ❌ BUNDLE NOT OK, user fetches

Core engine is **Apache 2.0** (redistribution-friendly). The bundled member
databases have mixed licenses, and the show-stoppers are:

- **ProSite (PROSITE Profiles + Patterns)** — SIB custom license: non-commercial,
  no derivatives. Forbids redistribution outside the InterPro bundle.
- **SMART** — EMBL academic-only; "redistribution path is via the InterPro
  consortium" per the SMART FAQ.
- **SUPERFAMILY** — no formal license (flagged ambiguous by reusabledata.org).

**Industry signal:** EBI's own
[`interpro/interproscan` Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/interpro/interproscan)
does *not* bundle the data — it expects the user to mount it. Bakta avoids IPS
entirely. No mainstream academic Docker image redistributes the IPS bundle.

**Action:** ssign Docker image has IPS *binary* (Apache 2.0) but no member-DB
data files. `scripts/fetch_databases.sh --tier extended` pulls the tarball
from EBI FTP at first install. User experience is one extra command, run
once.

## EggNOG database — ⚠️ AMBIGUOUS, awaiting EMBL response

EggNOG-mapper code is **AGPL-3.0**, redistribution-friendly. The database
itself is the issue.

We checked the [EggNOG website](http://eggnog5.embl.de/), the entire download
tree at `/download/`, the `eggnog-mapper` repo, the EggNOG 5.0 paper
(Huerta-Cepas et al., NAR 2019), and the wiki. **No license clause is stated
anywhere** — only third-party MIT notices for the website's bundled JS
(Bootstrap).

Under default copyright law (EU/Germany, EMBL-Heidelberg), absence of a
license means **all rights reserved** — silence is not permission. Bakta,
Prokka, and nf-core/funcscan all use `download_eggnog_data.py` as the
install path; no public Docker image redistributes the ~50 GB database.

**Action:** v1.0.0 Docker image fetches the EggNOG DB via `eggnog-mapper`'s
own `download_eggnog_data.py` at first install (same UX as IPS). In parallel,
the Billerbeck Lab has emailed `eggnog@embl.de` to request explicit
redistribution permission; if granted, a future release can bundle the DB
to make the Docker image fully self-contained.

## SignalP 6.0 + DeepLocPro — ⏳ Awaiting DTU response

Both released by DTU under an academic-only license. The license issued to
the Billerbeck Lab covers internal academic use. Whether ssign can include
the **binary + model weights** inside its public Docker image is currently
under discussion with DTU.

Two outcomes possible:

1. **DTU permits redistribution** — bundle inside Docker image, document
   academic-use restriction, users get a smooth `docker pull` experience.
2. **DTU requires per-user acquisition** — Docker image expects a bind-mount
   pointing at the user's own DTU-licensed install at runtime. Documented in
   `docs/how-to/install.md`.

Until DTU responds, the default **remote API mode** (via BioLib) requires no
license and is the current shipping path.

## DTU/SignalP — Phobius and TMHMM omitted from ssign

ssign's IPS configuration explicitly excludes Phobius, SignalP, and TMHMM
from InterProScan analyses (see `DEFAULT_IPS_APPLICATIONS` in
`run_interproscan.py`) — these member analyses each require their own
license and the IPS distribution itself ships pre-stripped of them. Not
relevant unless a user opts back in via `--applications`.

## Outstanding correspondence

External actions still in flight before v1.0.0 release (tracked under the
license-audit task in the publication roadmap):

- **DTU email** (Sonja Billerbeck → DTU) — SignalP 6.0 + DeepLocPro
  redistribution in our Docker image. Draft in roadmap.
- **EMBL-EggNOG email** (Sonja Billerbeck → eggnog@embl.de) — EggNOG database
  redistribution. Draft in roadmap.

Once both replies are in, this page gets updated and either the Docker image
gets fatter (bundling more) or the fetch-script story gets fleshed out.

## How license decisions feed into the install experience

Ssign's three-tier install (`pip install ssign[base|extended|full]`) maps onto
the licensing decisions above:

- The Docker image carries everything the user is *legally* allowed to receive
  from us in one pull.
- `scripts/fetch_databases.sh` (Phase 4b) handles the rest in a single
  `--tier` invocation that reads the tier name and downloads each missing DB
  from its canonical source.

Net user experience: `docker pull` → `ssign install-databases --tier extended`
→ `ssign run input.gbff`. Three commands, two of them once-only.
