## DeepLocPro crashes on mega-proteins — FIXED 2026-06-18 (openspec deeplocpro-mega-protein-guard)

SHIPPED: DeepLocPro wrapper now withholds sequences > DEEPLOCPRO_MAX_AA (5000, env-overridable)
from the model and emits them as "Not predicted (too long)" rows; the run no longer crashes.
Remaining: rerun BX470251 on CX3 to confirm 24/24 → 67/67, then archive the change. Original report:


Fleet genome **BX470251** (Photorhabdus laumondii TTO1, 4683 proteins) failed: DeepLocPro
exited 1 (GPU OOM, deterministic across 2 nodes), and as a CORE step it cascaded the whole
genome to failure (8/24 steps). Cause: **plu2670 is 16,367 aa** (next longest 5,457) — a giant
Tc/Mcf toxin / NRPS megasynthase. DeepSecE + SignalP handled the genome fine; only DeepLocPro
died. `run_deeplocpro.py` local path (`deeplocpro -f .. -o .. -g negative -d cuda`) has NO
length guard (the 500 cap is DTU sequence-COUNT only). This is a general defect: any toxin/
secondary-metabolite-rich genome (Photorhabdus, Xenorhabdus, giant adhesins) carries mega-
proteins that will kill a run. Matters for the publication + zero-maintenance/longevity pitch.

**Fix (a small change, needs /opsx:propose):** in the DeepLocPro wrapper, set aside sequences
over a safe length (~5000 aa) before invoking DeepLocPro, mark them unpredicted (or default
localization) in the output with a warning, so a single mega-protein can't crash a core step.
Consider the same guard for the other PLM predictors (DSE/SignalP/PLM-E) defensively.
Trigger: implement to get BX470251 to 67/67 and future-proof toxin-rich genomes. Note the
fleet output currently lives on $EPHEMERAL (home FS was ENOSPC at 9% quota — separate RCS issue).

## enrichment-stats validation + PLM-E over-prediction (2026-06-17)

Findings on the PAO1 smoke run (job 3013556), analysis in
`validation_sweeps/benchmark/analysis/enrichment_validation/` (scripts 01/02, figs 01-05):
- **Background bug**: the 200-protein null undershoots the true non-neighborhood background
  (DLP 0.5% vs ~1.3-1.65%, DSE 1.0% vs ~1.4-1.7%), inflating significance. Null-size sweep: 200
  over-calls, 1000 ≈ converged to "all". One false DSE call removed going 200->1000.
- **PLM-E over-predicts massively**: 25.3% of the PAO1 proteome called effector at native
  threshold, 18% even gated at max_prob>=0.8. T6SE-dominated (loosest threshold 0.5), T2SE
  essentially never (their weak type), 36% multi-type. Per-system enrichment: only 2/18 systems
  significant (both weak/spurious), and the real T3SS is DEPLETED (2/25). PLM-E adds no reliable
  enrichment signal. Paper (Zheng 2026 bbag143) reports specificity only on ~150 curated negatives,
  no genome-scale FPR test; recall-tuned thresholds + OR-of-5-ensembles guarantee inflation at scale.

DECISIONS (Teo, 2026-06-17), to implement via a new OpenSpec change (no active change covers this; #70):
1. n_null default 200 -> 1000; use ALL non-neighborhood proteins for the background when predictors
   ran whole-genome (free, exact).
2. PLM-E positivity gated at max_prob >= 0.8 everywhere it's a binary call (enrichment +
   cross_validate), consistent with DLP/DSE.
3. PLM-E OFF by default entirely (Teo's call after seeing the 25%/18% over-prediction).
4. Drop PLM-E from the enrichment test (subsumed by 3, but keep explicit if PLME is ever re-enabled).
Trigger: run `/opsx:propose` for these, pending the deeper PLM-E paper research (2 agents running).

Pre-fleet-launch: CX3 checkout needs `git pull` (job 3013556 predated the PLME-enrichment wiring
a7afbd9 and the SP_WHOLE_GENOME opt-in).

## effector-recovery-benchmark — CITATION-INTEGRITY: NEXT TASK (2026-06-12)

**CONFIRMED real** (not an agent hallucination): 3/3 spot-checks via CrossRef API (deterministic)
match the audit agents exactly — celA/plaA DOI = a soil-16S-ecology paper, VirA DOI = a mouse
tooth-development paper, Tle4 DOI = a protein-design paper. Genes are REAL (real loci/genomes);
it's the sourcing-DOI metadata that's wrong, + 2 genuine SS-type mislabels (BopA/BopE = Bsa T3SS
not T6SS). Our own `doi_resolves` col is blank for all 19 and `verification_status`=VERIFIED, so
"VERIFIED" never meant "DOI points to the right paper."

**CAVEAT — don't extrapolate:** the 19 audited are the most-suspicious slice (emitted-but-machinery-
far), NOT a random sample. 14/19 defective there says nothing reliable about the other ~480.
Prevalence across the full set is unknown → must be measured.

**Precision blind spot:** ssign emitted 1,933 (default) / 2,321 (t3ss) secreted proteins panel-wide;
only 39/51 are gold effectors → **1,894 / 2,270 emissions are unvalidated** (novel TP or FP, no
ground truth). Benchmark measures recall only, says nothing about precision.

**AGREED NEXT STEP (Teo, 2026-06-12):** deterministic citation-consistency sweep (CrossRef
title+abstract vs the row's gene/organism/SS-type; flag mismatches; NO agents in pass 1), then
targeted re-audit of flagged rows. **SCOPE: only the ssign-FOUND effectors for now** (the ~51
emitted_secreted gold effectors in `actual_per_effector.panel_genbank_t3ss.tsv`), to save time —
not the full 582. Items 3 (triage wrong-DOI-vs-mislabel by training impact) + 4 (precision estimate
for the 1.9k unlabeled emissions) deferred to discussion when we get there.

**PASS-1 DONE (2026-06-12)** — secretion-classifier-dataset task 6.1, `scripts/41_citation_consistency.py`
→ `data/dataset/citation_consistency_found.tsv`. **A join bug was caught and fixed mid-task** (the first
reported numbers were partly wrong): joining found→positives on raw UniProt collapsed the 17 found
effectors with `uniprot='-'` (a truthy dash) onto one arbitrary positives row (12 shared DOI nature11433)
→ garbage organism/DOI for those rows. Fixed by bridging found→`ceiling_per_effector` by (effector_locus,
gene) → gold `instance_id`, then keying positives by (instance_id, gene, ss). All 51 now resolve via
instance, 35 distinct DOIs (`join_method` column records how).

**Corrected result (51 found):** **21 CONSISTENT** (14 by gene name, 7 genus-only = weaker),
**8 FLAG_WRONG_TOPIC** (DOI in an unrelated field — celA/plaA→soil ecology, Map×2→Toxoplasma,
VirA→tooth development, BipB→colicins, aprA→CS1 pilin, and **EspZ→the T6SS-discovery PNAS paper**),
**3 FLAG_GENE_ABSENT** (prtB/prtA1/aprA cite a real Prt/Lip ABC-exporter T1SS paper that just doesn't
name the protease in its abstract — probably OK, confirm in pass-2), **3 DOI_UNRESOLVED** (YspE/CopN/
ChlaDub1 — classic ASM/JBC/Science DOIs failing the DOI.org handle check; likely legacy false-negatives
or typos), **16 INDETERMINATE** (CrossRef record exists but no abstract → can't refute deterministically).
Net: the deterministic method adjudicates ~30/51; 16 indeterminate + 14 flagged = 30 go to pass-2.
Validated vs the 19 prior manual verdicts: re-flagged celA/plaA/VirA independently AND caught **BipB's
wrong DOI the manual audit missed** (it was "sound" only because its agent was AUP-blocked; the DOI is a
colicin paper). Also: **aprA has two instances with two different DOIs** (one wrong CS1-pilin, one OK-ish
lipase) → the defect is per-row metadata, not per-protein. Caveat: ssign-found ~10% slice; full-582
prevalence still unmeasured.

**PASS-2 DONE (task 6.2)** — `pass2_results.tsv` + `pass2_results.md`; raw returns `pass2_raw/batch_*.json`;
verify `scripts/42_pass2_verify.py`. 30 non-CONSISTENT rows re-audited: 5 literature agents +
batch C (YspE/VirA/BipB/CopN/ChlaDub1) done in-session via PubMed (agent AUP-blocked on B. pseudomallei).
Every returned DOI deterministically re-verified (registered + on CrossRef + gene/genus present):
**26 rows now carry a verified-real on-topic primary DOI** (21 RESOLVED corrected, 3 CONFIRMED,
2 MISASSIGNED), **0 fabricated/unverified DOIs** — the agents agreed with the deterministic check on all
26, so they were reliable here.

**Dataset edits this produced (for the training set, NOT yet applied):**
- **2 MISASSIGNED ss_type:** BopA + BopE (B. thailandensis BTH_II rows) are **Bsa T3SS** effectors, not
  T6SS (name-collision; BopA=Cullinane 2008, BopE=Stevens 2003). Fix ss_type or drop. These are 2 of the
  benchmark's 6 "accidental cross-type" emissions.
- **4 NOT_FOUND (drop/down-tier):** ChlaDub1 (no T3SS-secretion evidence, DUB-only per Misaghi 2006);
  P.entomophila aprA (homology-only, no ortholog-specific T1SS paper); EFF00136 + EFF00150 (BTH DUF3274
  proteins not named in their cited paper).
- **1 duplicate:** Tle4 (idx15) = TplE_alias_Tle4 (idx24) = PA1510; BOTH also had wrong DOIs (protein-
  design / lung-regeneration papers) → correct = Jiang 2016 Cell Rep 10.1016/j.celrep.2016.07.012. De-dupe.
- EFF00142's pass-1 "unidentifiable" tag was WRONG: Russell 2012 names BTH_I2691 as a T6SS-1 substrate → CONFIRMED.
- EspZ's DOI was the T6SS-discovery PNAS paper → corrected to Kanack 2005 (10.1128/IAI.73.7.4327-4337.2005).

**ITEM 3 DONE (2026-06-12, task 6.3)** — applied to `positives_all.tsv` via `scripts/43_apply_citation_corrections.py`
(post-build overlay, **930→925 rows**). Triaged by training impact: **22 pure-provenance DOI fixes** (label
unchanged), **2 label-changing** (BopA/BopE T6SS→T3SS, re-labelled to type-level T3SS + DOI fixed), **5 removed**
(4 unsupported + TplE_alias_Tle4 duplicate → `positives_removed_citation.tsv`). Backup =
`positives_all.pre_citation_audit.tsv`; per-field log = `citation_corrections_log.tsv`. Verified surgical
(ss_type counts moved exactly T1−1/T3+1/T6−5; other instances of EspZ/Tle4 untouched), idempotent, and
byte-identical on re-run from the backup.

**Load-bearing caveats:**
- **Overlay, not in the build chain:** re-running `37_fold_t5ss.py` regenerates the uncorrected 930-row table,
  so `43` MUST be re-applied after any `37` rebuild. Documented in `data/dataset/README.md` "Citation-audit overlay".
- **Downstream re-run:** `40_pair_features.py` (and the eventual feature matrix) must be rebuilt — 2 ss_type
  changes + 5 dropped rows. pair_features.tsv is now stale.
- **Out of scope (real, deferred):** the audit only touched the ssign-FOUND rows. Other non-found instances may
  carry the SAME wrong DOIs — confirmed: a second EspZ instance (T3SS_24) still cites the T6SS-discovery PNAS
  paper. Fixing those is the full-corpus citation sweep (the original "prevalence unknown" item), still deferred.

**ITEM 4 DONE (2026-06-12, effector-recovery-benchmark §8)** — deterministic precision estimate, scripts
28→29→30→31, `data/phase2/PRECISION.md` + `figures/precision/01..03`. Teo chose deterministic tiers only
(DB-confirmed floor + obvious-FP), agent-sampled adjudication deferred. Denominator = the 1,572 proximity
substrate calls (default); 361 T5SS-self assessed separately (correct-by-construction; 68% effector /
0.3% housekeeping → T5SS detection sound). **Result: proximity precision is a wide band, ~3% provable
floor (DB-confirmed homology to SecReT4/6; T6SS the only well-covered type at 8.3%) → ~75% soft ceiling
(not-obviously-non-secreted), with ~19% clearly-FP housekeeping, ~6% machinery, ~11% annotation-effector,
and ~64% (hypothetical+other) unresolvable by DB or annotation.** Pairs with recall (8–10% emitted of
testable): the proximity rule is both permissive AND low-recall → the case for the classifier, which can
adjudicate the unresolvable middle. Tier-1 used pyhmmer phmmer (no external aligner; the repo venv is at
`../../.venv`, NOT `benchmark/.venv` — stdlib scripts silently fell back to system python3).

**Caveats baked into PRECISION.md:** no negative ground truth (ceiling overstates); annotation-based tier
inherits genome-annotation errors (NleB mis-annotated "IS3 transposase"); DB floor covers only T4/T6SS.

**STILL OPEN:** the full-corpus citation sweep (point 41→42→43 at the unaudited rows; defect confirmed
beyond the found slice), and optionally a stratified agent-adjudicated precision sample to place a point
estimate inside the 3–75% band. Both deferred to discussion with Teo.

### Earlier deferred repair items (from the 19-row audit; full table in `data/phase2/discordant_audit.md`):
- **Wrong/nonexistent sourcing DOI (≥9):** celA, plaA, VirA, ChlaDub1(404), CopN(404), Tle4, TplE, Tle1, Tae4_Stm. Re-source before trusting.
- **Genuine misassignment:** BopA, BopE labelled T6SS but are Bsa **T3SS** effectors (Bop name-collision) → reassign. ChlaDub1 T3SS call unsupported (inclusion-membrane DUB) → review.
- **Unidentifiable/unsupported rows:** EFF00142, EFF00150 (opaque DB placeholders), TseA_T6SS1 (cited paper never names it) → drop or repair.
- **Duplicate row:** Tle4 == TplE_alias_Tle4 (PA1510/Q9I3K2) → de-dupe.
- Same defect class likely across the wider corpus → run citation audit on ALL positives, not just these 19.
- BipB/BipC agents blocked by AUP filter on B. pseudomallei content; checked manually (sound Bsa T3SS translocon). If a future agent audit is needed, run those two by hand.

## effector-recovery-benchmark — FULL PANEL DONE (2026-06-12)

12 jobs (2988054-2988065) finished clean on CX3 gpu72: both tags 67/67 genomes, 0 empty/failed, 196,170 protein rows each. Synced to `data/phase2/runs/panel_genbank_{default,t3ss}/`; scored with scripts 24 + 25. Outputs `data/phase2/actual_{per_effector,vs_ceiling}.panel_genbank_{default,t3ss}.tsv`.

**Exact ssign-detected systems behind the found effectors** (`scripts/26_found_systems.py`, `found_systems.*.tsv`): default 39 found effectors via **32** distinct detected systems; t3ss 51 via **39**. Emission basis (why emitted): default own-type(legit) **33/39**, cross-type-only(accidental) **6/39**; t3ss own-type **45/51**, cross-type-only **6/51**. So the large majority of found effectors sit next to their OWN system type; only **6** are accidental cross-type emissions (the celA/plaA-via-T4aP, BopA/BopE-via-T5cSS, VirA/ChlaDub1-via-T5aSS set, same as the audit's cross-type rows). NB: required a family-normalization fix in script 26 (ssign labels detected systems by TXSScan subtype `T6SSi`, not the coarse `T6SS`); an earlier uncorrected run wrongly showed ~half accidental.

**Full-panel recall (emitted of testable, testable=499):**

| SS | testable | ceiling@7 | actual default | actual t3ss |
|----|---|---|---|---|
| T1SS | 25 | 80% | 60% | 60% |
| T2SS | 77 | 4% | 5% | 5% |
| T3SS | 227 | 33% | 1% | 7% |
| T4SS | 98 | 10% | 0% | 0% |
| T6SS | 72 | 26% | 24% | 24% |
| ALL | 499 | 25% | **8%** | **10%** |

Headline: even within +/-7 genes (ceiling 25%), as-shipped ssign emits 8% (T3SS-excluded) / 10% (T3SS-included). The ceiling-to-actual gap (25% -> 8-10%) is the core motivation for the secretion-classifier. T4SS actual=0% is the starkest gap (ceiling 10%, emits nothing). T3SS default=1% is by-design (excluded); the t3ss pass lifts it to 7%, still far under the 33% ceiling. 16-19 effectors emitted but ceiling-unreachable@7 = ssign's detected machinery disagrees with the literature answer key (mostly T6SSi self-adjacency, a few T5aSS/T4aP); benign, listed in script-25 output.

Denominator honesty: 14 no_run (effectors with no genome accession, all non-testable) + 75 not_in_input (only 6 testable; ssign's ORF set didn't carry those 6 loci = forced misses already counted against recall). Nothing inflated.

**T3SS detection CLARIFIED (2026-06-12), corrects the CLAUDE.md "MacSyFinder found 0 T3SS" framing for THIS panel.** `excluded_systems` (default `Flagellum,Tad,T3SS`) is a DOWNSTREAM FILTER, not a detection switch (`system_filtering.py:39`, `validate_macsyfinder_systems.py:148` separates included vs excluded AFTER parsing all MacSyFinder results). MacSyFinder/TXSScan models T3SS and runs it every time. In the t3ss-included panel run it **detected 30 real T3SS systems** (Pseudomonas/Bordetella/Chlamydia/Salmonella/Shigella, `excluded=False`); the default run shows 0 only because the filter drops them. So T3SS is OFF by default NOT because MacSyFinder can't find injectisomes (it can) but because DeepSecE over-predicts T3SS by misclassifying flagellar proteins (CLAUDE.md bug #4) — excluding it protects precision. Even with T3SS on, found only 3→15 because ~73% of T3SS effectors are genome-dispersed (unreachable @±3). The CLAUDE.md "0 across 74 genomes" note is about an older/different dev set; don't treat it as true for the benchmark panel.

**"Non-testable" (83) ≠ "no genome" — it's a mix** (corrects the figure-01 shorthand): effector_locus_not_found 26, own_instance_unknown 25 (the dropped net-new T6SS multi-instance effectors), no_genome 11+2 divergent, machinery_unanchored 10, no_instance_in_genome 8. All mean "couldn't fairly put it in front of ssign" (no assembly, ORF absent from the staged assembly, or no anchorable machinery to measure ±3 against), so excluded from the found/missed judgement.

**UNREACHABLE-MISSED ANALYSIS DONE (2026-06-12)** — `data/phase2/UNREACHABLE_ANALYSIS.md` + `figures/summary/04_distance_to_machinery.png` (script 33) + 5 literature agents. **Distances to machinery (testable): T1SS median 1 gene (20/23 within ±3 = operonic, Teo's intuition correct); T2SS 302, T3SS 45, T4SS 203, T6SS 232.** So T2/T3/T4SS effectors are GENUINELY genome-dispersed → high unreachable@3 is EXPECTED biology, not a ssign/benchmark failure (T2 substrates recruited post-translationally in periplasm; T3 effectors horizontally acquired on prophages/islands, shared-regulon-coordinated; T4 effectors recognized by portable C-terminal signal, location decoupled — Legionella/Coxiella ~300 scattered). The 5 T1SS misses are all genuine biology (Serralysin=LipBCD generalist exporter at separate locus; ApxIIA=in-trans via apxI-BD; FrpC=functional but scattered T1SS, no adjacent TolC/HlyB to detect; TRP47/32=T1SS but Hly transporter at separate locus). Core argument for the classifier: a fixed proximity window is the wrong abstraction for the dispersed systems.

**On the frpC/TolC question (Teo):** ssign detected NO T1SS in the Neisseria genome and there's no TolC/HlyB/HlyD adjacent to frpC — the apparatus is real but genome-scattered, so nothing to detect nearby. The answer-key "TolC at 1340 genes" is a spurious product-tier match.

**3 ACTIONABLE FOLLOW-UPS surfaced:**
1. **[DONE 2026-06-12]** TRP47/TRP32 (Ehrlichia, T1SS) were anchored on **VirB8 (a T4SS gene)**; +3. **[DONE]** frpC anchored on a spurious TolC 1340 genes away. `scripts/34_answer_key_corrections.py` reclassifies all 3 → `machinery_unanchored` / non-testable (correct machinery not anchorable; checked: ssign detects NO secretion system in either the Ehrlichia or Neisseria genome, and no Hly/TolC is adjacent — ssign could not have found them regardless). Found count unchanged (all not_emitted); testable 499→496; T1SS unreachable 5→2 (now just the genuine-biology Serralysin + apxIIA). Backups `*.pre_anchor_fix`. Figures 01/04 regenerated.
**FALSE-NEGATIVE DIAGNOSIS DONE (2026-06-12, task 8.7)** — `FALSE_NEGATIVES.md` + `figures/summary/05` (script 35). Of the 62 reachable@3-but-missed effectors, **50 (81%) are DETECTION failures**: ssign detected no secretion system, and the secreted-protein predictors run ONLY on the ±3 neighborhood of a detected system (`runner.py` dlp_whole_genome=False), so the effector was never evaluated (all tool signals blank). Per type: T1SS 5/5 detection, T3SS 37/40, T4SS 6/6, T6SS 2/11 (T6SS is the exception: 9/11 were processed-but-filter-rejected — the genuine prediction-side misses). **T1SS clincher:** all 5 are RTX toxins; HlyA in a COMPLETE genome (NZ_CP031766.1) has the full hlyC-A-B-D operon annotated (transporter 1-2 genes away) yet ssign called no T1SS. Likely cause: TXSScan T1SS model needs a co-localized TolC, but TolC is a distant housekeeping gene, so no complete system assembles. **Recall is bottlenecked by SS DETECTION, not the predictors.** Two takeaways: (1) ssign-side fix — T1SS detection should tolerate non-co-localized TolC / accept HlyB+HlyD operons; (2) a per-protein learned classifier (not gated on detection+proximity) would recover these obvious toxins = the recall-side classifier argument. **Open drill-down:** the 9 T6SS processed-but-rejected cases (why did cross-validation reject them?).

2. **[STILL OPEN] T6SS ceiling likely UNDERCOUNTED:** we anchor on the core tss cluster (TssM/ClpV), but many T6SS effectors sit beside an orphan vgrG/paar/hcp far from the core, with cognate immunity downstream. Add a nearest-vgrG/paar + immunity-pair anchor and recompute T6SS reachable@3 (likely rises; ssign detects vgrG so some "unreachable" T6SS may be reachable). The one system where apparent proximity-failure is partly a benchmark-anchor choice, not biology.

**Next (now unblocked):** 6.6/6.7 figures + docs; dataset group-4 4.1 feature join (the `actual_per_effector.*.tsv` tables ARE the per-protein tool signals). Benchmark-side bridge/SUBMIT/script changes still UNCOMMITTED (not yet approved).

## effector-recovery-benchmark — Phase 2 pilot results + FASTA bridge bug (2026-06-11)

4-genome pilot (NC_002516.2/003197.2/004337.2/004578.1) ran on CX3, 3 tags x 4 genomes, all 20/20 steps. Synced to `data/phase2/runs/`; scored with scripts 24 + 25. Outputs: `data/phase2/actual_{per_effector,vs_ceiling}.<tag>.tsv`.

- **In-panel pilot numbers (genbank_default):** of 118 testable effectors in the 4 genomes, ceiling-reachable@7 = 30 (25%), ssign emitted 4 = **3% of testable / 13% of proximity-reachable@7**. T3SS-enabled tag: 6 emitted = 5% / 20%. The gap is large and real (supports the classifier; doc 00 decision tree "gap >20% -> proceed"). NB script 25's printed table dilutes "actual" across all 499 effectors incl. 445 no_run (not-in-this-4-genome-pilot) -> shows 1%; the in-panel 3-5% is the honest pilot number. **Full panel run needed for real figures (6.6/6.7).**
- **FASTA-mode bridge — FIXED 2026-06-11 (coordinate bridge).** Was 0/137 matched: Bakta renames locus_tags (`NFOBNJ_00001`) and the seq fallback read a `sequence` column ssign's results_raw never emits. Fix: `bench_runout.RunOutput.find_by_coord` + `by_coord` index match on (contig_base, strand, 3'-stop) since Bakta calls the same ORF at the same RefSeq coordinate; script 24 looks up effector coords from the gene-order index. Result: **0→116 matched, and the emitted set is identical to genbank mode** (4 effectors, exact), confirming correctness. Remaining 21 unmatched are effectors with no locus_tag at all (unbridgeable). If ssign ever emits an aa `sequence` column, the seq bridge reactivates automatically (kept as a later tier).
- **3 emitted-but-ceiling-unreachable@7** (VirA/Q7BU69 T3SS nearby=T5aSS; Tle4 + TplE_alias_Tle4 T6SS nearby=T6SSi): ssign emitted these off a *different* nearby system than the literature answer-key assigns. This is the benchmark task-6b "ssign machinery != literature instance" signal; capture in the 6b write-up, not a bug.

## CX3 environment

- **signalp6 + deeplocpro PATH on fresh nodes** (task #22). Now auto-discovered via `_find_in_conda_envs` in `core/runner.py`. Binaries execute directly without `conda activate`, which works for pip-installed Python entry points because the shebang pins the env's Python. **Open risk:** if either tool's torch build needs system CUDA libs (rather than its own bundled CUDA wheels), `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` won't include `<env>/lib/` and the subprocess will crash with `libcudnn.so.X not found`. Mitigation if it ever fires: prepend `<env>/lib` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in `run_signalp.py` / `run_deeplocpro.py` when the binary path lives under a conda env. Trigger to revisit: a CUDA-related ImportError from either wrapper.

## PLM-Effector performance

- **Ensemble model checkpoint cache** (task #16). `run_ensemble` now called 85× instead of 5×; re-reads ~150 MB of small files per call. Page cache makes real cost ~150 MB total, so lower priority than the raw number suggests. Revisit: if PLM-E step wallclock is still the long pole after `0445d94` cross-type caching is validated.
- **FP16/BF16 + `--batch-size 32`**. Could drop PLM-E ~74m → ~12-15m on whole-genome runs. Needs validation that FP16 doesn't shift predictions. Now low priority: PLM-E runs on the SS neighborhood (~128 proteins) by default, so absolute wallclock is small. Only revisit if `--plme-whole-genome` becomes a common workflow.

## Disk sizes (measured 2026-06-03 on CX3, scripts/audit_disk_sizes.py)

- **base 2 GB / extended 140 GB / full 1.3 TB**. BLAST nr is the long pole at 802 GB; users without nr-cross-genome BLASTp save 1.2 TB by staying on extended. UniRef30 dominates HH-suite at 261 GB. Several install.md per-tool estimates were ~50% off (EggNOG 25→47, IPS 24→35, PLM-E 18→26, HH-suite 55→340). Updated in docs/how-to/install.md.

## Torch.load safety

- **Migrate `run_deepsece.py` to `weights_only=True` + `add_safe_globals`.** DeepSecE's checkpoint is a state_dict (already loaded via `model.load_state_dict(...)`), not a whole-module pickle like PLM-Effector's, so it's a safe candidate for the stricter loader PyTorch 2.6 introduced. PLM-E itself can't migrate (whole-module saves; would need an upstream refactor). Revisit: any time a new ssign dep bumps torch and `weights_only=False` triggers a deprecation warning.

## Annotation parallel-group scheduling

- **Wave-scheduling or finish-and-redistribute** (deferred 2026-06-03). After fixing the 3-4x oversubscription bug (commit `82cece9`), each annotation tool now gets `effective_cpu_count / N` cores in the parallel group. Remaining inefficiency: when one tool (e.g. IPS at 36m) finishes before the others (EggNOG, pLM-BLAST), the cores it released sit idle because the surviving tools were started with a fixed thread count and can't add workers mid-run. Three options considered: (1) two-wave scheduling (fast tools then slow tools), (2) restart-survivors-with-more-threads (throws away expensive embed/diamond work), (3) leave as-is. Going with (3) for now. **Trigger to revisit:** once we have step_timings.csv from a few post-fix runs across different genome sizes — if there's a consistent 10-20%+ wallclock floor that's clearly tail-tool dominated, the wave-scheduling experiment becomes worth it.

## Benchmark: T1SS effector rescue (effector-recovery-benchmark, 2026-06-11)

The corpus left 19 of 28 validated T1SS effectors without a genome (old UniProt entries cite 1980s-90s EMBL gene clones, not assemblies), so they were untestable for the proximity ceiling. Per Teo's decision (representative-species placement; floor set to >=90% id after he asked to include the 93% prtA), `scripts/12_rescue_t1ss_ipg.py` (IPG, identical protein) + `13_rescue_t1ss_blast.py` (remote blastp, >=90% id / >=90% cov) + `14_finalize_t1ss_rescue.py` placed **16/19** into RefSeq genomes (9 IPG-identical, 7 BLAST; 13 exact-species, 3 genus-only). Output: `data/t1ss_rescue/t1ss_rescued.tsv`. (prtA Q07295 = 93.1% in same-species D. chrysanthemi SR64; the rest 98-100%.)

- **3 still unplaced, with reasons (genuinely unplaceable, not a decision):**
  - `prtG` (Q07162, Dickeya chrysanthemi): best genome match only **61%** id. Genuinely divergent.
  - `prtA` (P82115, Photorhabdus sp. Az29) + `lktA` (P55123, "Pasteurella haemolytica-like sp. 5943B"): "no significant similarity" because those exact strains have **no RefSeq genome**; the search was correctly species-restricted. *A genus-level fallback (flagged genus_only) could rescue the conserved leukotoxin; the Photorhabdus one is a partial UniProt entry and riskier.* Trigger to revisit: if Teo later wants >=18/19, add a genus-level BLAST fallback.
- **Adjacency verified (script 15 + 16, 2026-06-11):** instead of assuming ceiling=100%, we read the gene order around each placed effector for the T1SS transporter (ABC/HlyB-family + HlyD-family MFP; literature families off RefSeq annotation, ssign-independent). **14/16 CONFIRMED adjacent** (transporter 1-3 genes away -> reachable at N=3). **2 genuine exceptions:** apxIIA (apxIICA operon lacks a transporter; trans-secreted by ApxIB/D from the distant apxI operon) + serralysin (Lip/LipBCD transporter at a separate locus, confirmed across 13 complete Serratia genomes). These 2 are real "impossible" cases. `16_t1ss_replace_fragmented.py` fixed hlyA (was on a 3 kb single-CDS WGS contig that truncated hlyCABD -> re-placed into complete genome NZ_CP031766.1, operon intact). Tables: `data/t1ss_rescue/t1ss_ceiling.tsv`.
- **Phase 1 integration still TODO:** fold the 16 placements into `effector_gold_set.tsv` (add `placement_tier` ipg_identical/representative_strain + `species_match` columns), add the placement genomes to the Phase 2 panel, and record the T1SS ceiling as 14 reachable + 2 impossible. Placement genomes already cached in `refseq_cache/`. Trigger: start of Phase 1.
- 3 placements are sister-species (genus_only): `prtA1` P.luminescens->P.akhurstii, `prtB`/`prtC` D.chrysanthemi->D.dadantii. Sequence is 100% identical (IPG), so defensible, but flagged.

## Benchmark: Phase 1 ceiling (effector-recovery-benchmark, 2026-06-11)

Phase 1 complete: ceiling = % of testable verified effectors the +/-N proximity rule could reach. **T1 80% / T2 1-4% / T3 21-33% / T4 6-10% / T6 22-26%; 499 testable, 83 untestable.** Scripts 17-21 + `scripts/bench_index.py`; outputs in `data/phase1/`, figures `figures/01-04`, writeup `docs/phase1_ceiling.md`. Deferred / judgment-call items:

- **33 net-new SecReT6 effectors dropped to untestable** (Teo's Checkpoint-A-consistent call): 25 in multi-T6SS genomes + 8 in Serratia SMDB11 with no curated T6SS instance. We do NOT guess the nearest instance (circular). T6SS ceiling rests on the 72 rigorously-assignable effectors. **Trigger:** if Phase 2 makes T6SS coverage worth expanding, literature-assign each net-new effector to its specific T6SS (SecReT6 citations), then re-run 19.
- **pulA (T2SS_16) untestable.** Its instance was dropped at Checkpoint A (X12831 = 1.8 kb EMBL pul fragment, not a genome); not backfilled. The founding T2SS effector is therefore not in the ceiling. **Trigger:** if wanted, place pulA into a complete K. pneumoniae genome + curate the gsp machinery there (real Phase 0b work).
- **26 effector_locus_not_found** = corpus locus_tag scheme absent from the available RefSeq assembly (different assembly/annotation), no unique gene symbol to bridge. Genuinely unplaceable in cache. **Trigger:** coordinate-based placement via UniProt->genome if completeness matters.
- **Gene-symbol fallback (9 effectors, incl. canonical Yersinia Yops on pYV).** Located by *unique* /gene symbol when the tag scheme was missing; flagged `effector_match=gene_symbol` in `ceiling_per_effector.tsv`. Uniqueness-gated (no paralog ambiguity), but a weaker identifier than locus_tag. Documented in `docs/phase1_ceiling.md` strengths.
- **off-replicon machinery -> impossible.** Effectors whose own-instance machinery anchored only to a different replicon are counted impossible (structurally unreachable by a +/-N window), not untestable. Reason `machinery_off_replicon` in the per-effector table.

## ssign output: emit genomic coordinates (base pipeline)

- **`results.csv` and `results_raw.csv` carry no genomic coordinates** (only `locus_tag`, `sequence`, per-tool signals). The intermediate `gene_info` step already has `contig,start,end,strand` (`extract_proteins.py:384`) but `_build_master_csv` / `_build_raw_csv` (`core/runner.py`) drop them. **Add `contig,start,end,strand` to the raw CSV at least** (left-join from gene_info, which is already the raw base). **Why it matters:** any coordinate-based downstream use (operon context, the effector-recovery benchmark's Bakta->RefSeq bridge, the secretion-classifier model's positional features) currently has to recover coordinates by re-parsing the input or matching on sequence. The benchmark Phase 2 worked around it with locus_tag + protein-sequence identity matching, but emitting coordinates removes the workaround and is generally useful. **Trigger:** next base-pipeline pass; small change, gene_info is already the join base in `_build_raw_csv`. (Flagged 2026-06-11 during effector-recovery Phase 2.)

## Statistics

- **(Resolved 2026-06-02)** The broken permutation + biased Fisher path was replaced by the A+ rewrite: opt-in `--enrichment-stats` flag, null sample of N=200 random non-SS-neighborhood proteins per genome, scipy binomial test per real SS system + per broad type, BH FDR. Multi-genome runs also emit a pooled view. See `enrichment_testing.py` + `pool_enrichment_stats` in `core/runner.py`.

## Shared TSV/parsing helpers (#75a simplify follow-up, resolved 2026-06-05)

- **Tolerant int parsing — resolved.** `ssign_lib/parsing.py:parse_int_or_none(value, allow_range=False)` is the single source. `t5_passenger` imports it directly; `t5ss_handler._parse_sp_end` is now a one-liner wrapping it with `allow_range=True` so call sites still read as `_parse_sp_end(...)`.
- **"Load TSV → dict by key" — resolved.** `ssign_lib/tsv_io.py:load_tsv_by_key(path, key_columns, missing_ok=True)` is the single source. `cross_validate_predictions._load_tsv_by_locus` passes the tolerant fallback chain `("locus_tag", "protein_id", "seq_id")`; `enrichment_testing.load_predictions_keyed` keeps strict-locus_tag-only via `key_columns=("locus_tag",)`. `t5_passenger.load_t5_classifications` was left as-is — it does substantial per-field coercion on top of the TSV read, so the shared helper would only save the open-and-iterate boilerplate.

## secretion-classifier-dataset — deferred re-citation (group 1, 2026-06-11)

- **25 predicted positives kept with UNRESOLVED citations** (`evidence_tier=predicted`, `citation_status=UNRESOLVED` in `data/dataset/predicted_audited.tsv`). The audit kept them (protein/locus/instance label is sound; the broken DOI is metadata, not a label, same bar as the validated gold set which also never drops on citation alone). 8 distinct broken DOIs: lktA/mbxA/movA RTX leukotoxins (11), prtA/prtC proteases (4), Ehrlichia T4SS EBP/ECH (3, IAI.00513-13), Shigella OspD2/3 (2, science.1175302), Anaplasma T4SS APH (2, cmi.13405), Chlamydia CT813 (1), V. vulnificus rtxA (1, JB.187.10.3392), Dickeya pelZ (1, annurev-micro-102215). 36 of the original 61 were already recovered (Apx ×32 → Frey 1993 10.1099/00221287-139-8-1723; ApxIVA ×2 → Schaller 1999; V. cholerae rtxA ×2 → Boardman 2004) in `doi_recite.jsonl`. **Trigger:** before any public release that cites the predicted tier, run a per-paper re-citation for these 8 (one paper each, all well-characterized families); add verified DOIs to `doi_recite.jsonl` and re-run scripts 31→32. Held back because applying a shaky umbrella citation to benchmark provenance is worse than an honest flag. The agent re-citation route hit an API policy block on toxin literature, so this was done inline; the remaining 8 need careful manual lookups.

## secretion-classifier-dataset — predicted instance audit flags (group 2, 2026-06-11)

The 2.3 literature-audit agent (27 RESOLVED / 17 UNRESOLVED of 44 ambiguous) flagged 3 corpus data-quality issues to fix upstream (assignment stands at gene/family level; not blocking):
- **C. rodentium ICC168 NleG locus_tags mislabeled.** Corpus has ROD_31501/ROD_21621/ROD_25881/ROD_15971; NCBI annotates those as exported-protein/hisA/prophage/hypothetical. Real ICC168 NleG tags are ROD_16511 / ROD_48891 / ROD_40971. **Trigger:** correct these 4 locus_tags in `T3SS_verified.tsv` before feature-join (else bench_runout won't find them in run output).
- **VopX / VPA1374 name-locus mismatch.** UniProt annotates VPA1374 as "Uncharacterized"; "VopX" is a V. cholerae effector. Left UNRESOLVED. **Trigger:** verify the V. parahaemolyticus locus for VopX (or drop if a mislabel).
- **EC042_4675 (Tle3_Sci2) unresolvable.** Locus returns zero NCBI/UniProt hits and sits ~100 genes outside both E. coli 042 T6SS clusters; documented EAEC 042 Tle is Tle1 (Sci-1). Left UNRESOLVED. **Trigger:** re-source the correct locus from the bioRxiv ref (10.1101/2025.02.11.637775) or drop.

## ssign extended tier is GPU-gated (PLM-Effector cannot fall back to CPU via runner)

- **Finding (2026-06-11, while diagnosing CX3 pilot queue):** `run_plm_effector.py` defaults `--device cuda` and `plm_effector/predict_api.py:_resolve_device` **raises RuntimeError if CUDA is absent** (only `device='cpu'` explicitly avoids it). `core/runner.py:_step_plm_effector` (~line 2377) builds the PLM-E argv WITHOUT a `--device` flag, so it always uses the cuda default. Net: **extended/full tier crashes at the PLM-Effector step on any GPU-free node** (CPU-only HPC nodes, Amine's Mac, laptops). DeepSecE already auto-selects CPU (`run_deepsece.py:_select_device`), so PLM-E is the lone hard GPU gate.
- **Impact:** can't schedule benchmark Phase-2 runs on the abundant CPU queues (must wait for gpu72 GPU). Also contradicts the "runs anywhere / zero-maintenance" longevity pitch and breaks Mac/laptop extended runs.
- **Fix:** add a `plm_effector_device` config knob + env (mirror DeepSecE's `_select_device` auto-detect: cuda if available else cpu) and pass `--device` through in `_step_plm_effector`. Keep cuda the default when a GPU exists (CPU is ~1-2 min/protein per the code's own warning, but the +/-3 neighborhood keeps protein counts small). **Trigger:** next base-pipeline pass, or sooner if the CX3 GPU queue stays multi-hour and we want to run the panel on CPU nodes.

## secretion-classifier-dataset — T5SS sourcing gaps (group 3, 2026-06-11)

T5SS sourced by subtype (scripts 36/37): 29 proposed → **23 placed + verified** (DOI.org-resolved + locus in genome), folded into `positives_all.tsv` (930 total). Subtypes: T5a 7, T5b 11, T5c 3, T5d 1, T5e 1. self_secreted=true for the 12 autotransporters (T5a/c/d/e), false for the 11 T5b TpsA substrates.

Deferred:
- **Autotransporter sourcing was cut short** by a wifi/socket drop after 18 entries (agent was targeting ~25-40). The brief's anchor list has more uncovered T5a/T5c examples (SPATEs Pic/Sat/Vat, IgA proteases, more TAAs: Hia/UspA2/BadA/SadA). **Trigger:** if more T5SS depth is wanted, re-run one autotransporter sourcing agent (it appends to `t5ss_raw/`, then 36→37 re-fold). Low urgency — T5SS is a supplementary/partly-exploratory tier.
- **6 unplaceable** (`t5ss_unplaceable.tsv`): hap (HI_0248 absent from NC_000907.1 — likely wrong tag), tsh (APECO1_O1CoBM73 tag mismatch), hia/badA/uspA1/invA (agent gave no usable locus_tag / no genome accession). **Trigger:** re-source these specific loci if T5SS coverage matters; each needs one targeted NCBI lookup.
- **GCF→nucleotide resolution is NCBI-flaky.** `36.replicons_for` uses assembly→elink→nuccore but NCBI eutils dropped connections (EOF) repeatedly; the 5 Haemophilus T5b were rescued by hardcoding GCF→NC in `tps.json` (NC_000907.1/NC_002940.2/NC_017452.1). If re-sourcing, prefer instructing agents to emit nucleotide (NC_/NZ_) accessions, not GCF.

## secretion-classifier-dataset — model-handoff deferrals (group 5, 2026-06-11)

`positives_all.tsv` (930) is the label-complete deliverable; `data/dataset/README.md` documents schema + conventions. Items below belong to later changes, not this one:

- **validated:predicted weight ratio is unset.** `evidence_tier` is recorded but the loss weight is a model-training decision. **Trigger:** the model-training change (nnPU loss); start from validated=1.0 and sweep predicted ∈ {0.3-0.7}.
- **Type-level positives (298 rows, `type_level=yes`) have no instance, so pair-features are null.** Whether they feed the instance model or only a separate type-level head is undecided. **Trigger:** model architecture design; if instance-only, hold the 298 out or route them to the type-level head.
- **T5SS subtype depth is a first pass** (23 placed: T5a 7 / T5b 11 / T5c 3 / T5d 1 / T5e 1). Depth decision (source more vs leave as supplementary) waits on whether the self-secreted tier helps. **Trigger:** after the first model eval shows whether self_secreted rows move the needle; if yes, re-run autotransporter sourcing (see group-3 note).
- **T5a-neighbor DLP/DSE observation stays exploratory.** The "autotransporter neighbours look secreted" signal lives in benchmark task 6b as a side-study, never a training label. **Trigger:** none for this dataset; revisit only if 6b finds it predictive.
- **Feature side (group 4) is blocked on CX3 Phase-2 panel runs.** `training_dataset.tsv` (positives + DLP/DSE/SignalP/PLM-E + ESM ref + gene-distance + PU unlabeled set) joins `results_raw` via `bench_runout` once runs land. **Trigger:** Phase-2 pilots flip Q→R on CX3 gpu72; then rsync runs back and run group-4 scripts (4.1-4.5, not yet written). The 4.5 assembler's output schema is now **pinned**: it must emit the columns in `secretion-classifier/secretion_classifier/schema.py` (REQUIRED_COLUMNS), which the model's `TrainingDataset` loader validates against. 4.2 pair-features (`pair_features.tsv`) already supplies the pair/system columns.
- **Model-prep core is built** (2026-06-11, separate repo `reidmat/secretion-classifier`, commits f641d32..3b04d54): data-independent loader/losses/prior/model/splits/metrics/sweep, 33 tests green. Only the trainer + ESM extraction + `training_dataset.tsv` remain, all gated on the same CX3 runs. See memory [[project_secretion_classifier_model]].
- **Label sentinels are a bare-string cross-file contract.** `evidence_tier`, `instance_source`, `type_level`, `self_secreted` values are bare literals shared across scripts 36/37 and (soon) group 4 (e.g. `self_secreted == "true"` in 37 depends on 36 writing `str(...).lower()`). A typo mislabels rows silently. **Trigger:** when writing the group-4 feature scripts, hoist these into a small shared label-constants block (e.g. in `bench_io.py`) and reuse across 36/37/group-4 rather than re-typing literals.

## Full-table citation audit (secretion-classifier-dataset, 2026-06-15)

Two-pass provenance audit over ALL 925 positives (not just the ssign-found 51 from the earlier pass).
Scripts 44-47. Pass 1 = deterministic CrossRef gene/genus check (44); pass 2 = 20 batched agents read
each cited paper and judged SUPPORTED/REFUTED/INACCESSIBLE under an anti-hallucination contract
(`deepverify_input/CONTRACT.md`); 46 merges, 47 applies. User policy = **strict: drop every refuted row.**

Result: **positives_all 925 -> 458.** Removed 467 = 252 pass-1 (wrong-topic 92 / gene-absent 74 / dead-DOI 86)
+ 215 deep-verify refuted (wrong_organism 152 / no_effector_evidence 30 / wrong_protein 27 / wrong_system 6).
Kept 458: verified_paper 330 (with verbatim quote), unverifiable 121 (paywalled, no counter-evidence),
verified_external 3, fallback_consistent 4. New cols on positives_all: `citation_trust`, `citation_quote`.
Backup `positives_all.pre_deepverify.tsv`; removal log `deepverify_removed.tsv`; per-row verdicts
`deepverify_results_full.tsv`; pass-1 verdicts `citation_consistency_full.tsv`.

Headline: only ~36% (333/925) of the original "literature-sourced" rows had a citation that holds up when
the paper is actually read. Many refutes are fabricated-DOI cases (DOI resolves to an unrelated paper:
SptP->GroEL, IcsB->vitamin-D, a T6SS effector->an astronomy paper). Consistent with an LLM-built answer key.

### DOWNSTREAM CASCADE (STALE — must propagate before any dataset/benchmark claim ships)
positives_all shrank 925->458, which invalidates everything built on the old table:
- **Benchmark recall/precision/false-negative figures** (`data/phase2/figures/summary/01-05`,
  `precision/01-03`) and the per-effector tables (`ceiling_per_effector.tsv`, `actual_per_effector.*.tsv`)
  use the old positives. The recall DENOMINATOR shrinks; recall % almost certainly RISES (most dropped rows
  were never in the ssign-found set). **Trigger:** before presenting any recall number, re-run the ceiling +
  actual + figure scripts against the 458-row table. Decide first whether the benchmark should measure recall
  over (a) only citation-verified effectors, or (b) verified+unverifiable. Recommend (a) for the headline,
  (b) as a sensitivity check.
- **40_pair_features.tsv** (was re-run to 925 rows) needs re-run to 458.
- **secretion-classifier-dataset group-4 feature matrix** (gated on CX3 runs) must build on the 458-row table.
- **evidence_tier vs citation_trust**: these are now two separate axes. validated/predicted is the curator's
  claim; citation_trust is what the paper actually supports. 67 rows are evidence_tier=validated but were
  refuted (mostly wrong_organism) and got dropped — so the surviving "validated" set is itself cleaner now.
- **The earlier found-set audit (scripts 41/42/43, positives 930->925) is now subsumed** by this full-table
  pass. Don't double-count its removals; 47 operates on the post-43 table (925) as input.

## T3SS on by default (requested 2026-06-15)
Teo: make T3SS detection ON by default in ssign and test it, then remove the "T3SS off by default"
footnote from the recall figures. The benchmark already validates a T3SS-on path (panel_genbank_t3ss
tag); MacSyFinder detects ~30 T3SS in the panel and the false-positive risk (DeepSecE flagellar
misclassification, 1808 spurious T3SS calls on the dev set) is the historical reason it was excluded
by default. **Trigger:** ssign-side default flip = drop T3SS from `excluded_systems` default in
constants.py; re-run the panel; confirm T3SS precision (the DeepSecE-misclassification concern) is
acceptable before shipping the default change. Figure footnote removed from 52_system_recall.py now.

## 2026-06-15 poster figures (deferred simplify)
- Skipped: full 4-agent simplify pass on the poster edits (52_system_recall.py render() refactor; 03_plot_fragmentation.py fig_04_recovery_poster; build_paired_heatmaps.py poster gate). Edits are small font-scale multipliers + a poster output gate; figures verified by eye. Trigger to revisit: next simplify sweep over benchmark scripts.

## 2026-06-16 T6SS audit (task #74) deferred fixes
Reconciled file: validation_sweeps/benchmark/data/phase2/verification/reconciled_T6SS.tsv (37 proteins R190-R226; 0 fabricated, 0 wrong genomes). Per-row suggested_fix is in that table. Two items need a decision beyond a citation swap:
- R207 BopC / R208 BopE (B. thailandensis E264, T6SS-5 / T6SS_09): all 4 audit passes agree these are misattributed. UniProt accessions point to a TssG baseplate subunit (BTH_II0865) + a 107aa uncharacterized protein (BTH_II0874); cited DOI (chom.2024.04.012) is the TssM-esterase paper and never mentions them; BopC/BopE are canonically T3SS(Bsa) effectors. Decision needed: DROP both from the gold set, or reclassify the B.thai T6SS-5 effector to VgrG5. Trigger: post-audit fix pass.
- Serratia Ssp/Rhs rows R221-R226 (SMDB11_ locus tags): source papers (English 2012, Fritsch 2013) use SMA tags; agent3 could not cross-confirm the SMDB11->SMA mapping and flagged possible drift for Ssp5 (SMDB11_2278, may be RhsI1 immunity region) and Ssp6 (SMDB11_4259 vs 4673). Proteins/refs are real; only the locus_tag provenance is unverified. Trigger: post-audit, spot-check the 6 SMDB11 tags against the Db10 GenBank.
- R214 YPK_3548: effector status rests on a T6SS4-expression/regulation paper (ppat.1013356), not a secretion/translocation assay; needs a better primary ref + a non-deleted accession.

## 2026-06-16 T5SS audit (task #74) — FINAL batch, full 245 audit complete

T5SS batch (19 proteins R227-R245, self-secreting autotransporters/TPS, in_gold_set=no): 4 independent passes (claude + 3 blind agents). **Fully clean: 0 fabricated, 0 wrong genome, 0 wrong/deleted UniProt, 0 wrong_ref.** 14 verified, 5 weak_ref (citation is on-topic but not the ideal secretion primary): R232 fhaB (prodomain-mechanism paper), R233 flu/Ag43 (chaperone-QC paper), R234 hmw1A (cites HMW1B translocator not HMW1A), R235 hpmA (cross-complementation paper), R237 iga (IgG3-specificity paper; UniProt Q51163 is a 496aa fragment of the ~1500aa AT). All 15 supplied accessions + all genomes correct (incl. correctly plasmid-encoded espP/pO157 and yadA/pYV). See reconciled_T5SS.tsv.

### Consolidated deliverable (deferred fixes, all 6 batches)
`validation_sweeps/benchmark/data/phase2/verification/audit_fixes_consolidated.tsv` — 101 rows needing a provenance fix, built from the 6 reconciled_*.tsv by /tmp/build_audit_summary2.py.
- 245 proteins audited, **0 fabricated, 0 wrong genome-accessions** (the 2 T1SS "wrong_organism" are citation-species mismatches, genome fine).
- 144 clean/verified (incl. 12 T2SS secretome-verified).
- 101 need a fix: 39 weak_ref, 24 wrong_ref, 14 wrong/bad DOI, 13 deleted_uniprot, 7 wrong_uniprot, 2 wrong_organism, 2 misattributed (T6SS R207/R208 BopC/BopE = real loci but T3SS effectors, drop-or-reclassify). 4 rows carry a deleted_uniprot on top of a ref defect.
- Verified-DOI replacements already captured in the per-batch reconciled files; weak_ref suggested_fixes are mostly direction-only (marked "unverified") — Crossref-confirm before writing any replacement DOI into the answer key.

**Conclusion: the recall-figure biology is trustworthy (no hallucinated proteins, no wrong genomes). The answer-key's provenance fields (DOIs + a handful of UniProt accessions) need repair, and BopC/BopE need a drop-or-reclassify call.**

## 2026-06-16 Answer-key fix-finding (task #75-79): fresh, blind-agent + reconcile

Per user "do a fresh finding, don't rely on old suggested DOIs". 9 blind agents (2x ClassA-DOI, 2x ClassB1 T1/T2, 1x B2 T3, 2x B3 T4/T5/T6, 2x ClassC uniprot) + my own pass, all finding via PubMed search -> abstract -> Crossref/EuropePMC title gate (never from memory). Reconciled to `validation_sweeps/benchmark/data/phase2/verification/reconciled_fixes.tsv` (101 rows). Final DOI set re-verified in one batch: 0 unresolved.

Counts: 91 auto-apply (74 DOI replacements + 20 uniprot remaps + 4 uniprot->blank + 9 locus_tag fixes), 2 keep_current (R060 lip, R066 zmpA: no better primary exists), 8 FLAG (need Teo's call).

Fresh-pass catches that the OLD suggested fixes got wrong (vindicates the rerun):
- R177 VirE3: old hint DOI 10.1073/pnas.0500396102 is DEAD (404). Correct = Vergunst 2003 Plant Physiol 10.1104/pp.103.029223.
- R113 VopS: old hint accession Q87GE8 is VPA1368 (T3SS inner-rod, 85aa), WRONG. Correct = Q87P32 (reviewed VopS, 387aa).
- R187 VceC: row locus is BAB2_0123 -> Marchesini 2011 (locus-exact); old hint de Jong 2008's VceC is BAB1_1058 (different locus).
- R006 aprA -> Liehl 2006 (P. entomophila, correct organism, not the P. aeruginosa homolog).
- R014/R015 lktA -> Davies 2002 (covers B. trehalosi + M. glucosida, fixes the wrong-organism citation).

NEW defect class uncovered: 9 wrong locus_tags in the answer key (not just citations):
- Ralstonia swaps: R104 PopC RSc0608->RSp0875, R106 AvrA RSp1130->RSc0608, R107 RipJ RSp0871->RSc2132 (RSp0871 was HrpD apparatus).
- R061 chiY YE3650->YE3576; R160 MavQ lpg2813->lpg2552; R161 MitF lpg2818->lpg1976; R168 SdjA lpg2155->lpg2508; R174 CinF CBU0041->CBU0513; R185 BtpB BAB1_0782->BAB1_0756.
- Also locus-uncertain (DOI fixed, locus flagged): R162 PieE lpg1924?->lpg1969, R163 PieF lpg1959?->lpg1972.

4 uniprots genuinely purged by UniProt (proteome removed, no same-locus replacement) -> set blank, keep refseq+locus: R062 engY(GenBank CAL12863), R063 ye3650(CAL13678), R064 cbpE(ABR85197), R213 YPK_0952(NCBI Gene 6091262).

8 FLAG / judgment calls pending Teo:
- R207 BopC, R208 BopE: misclassified T6SS dup; gold set already has correct T3SS/Bsa rows 203/204. RECOMMEND DROP.
- R214 YPK_3548: demonstrated substrate is YPK_3549=YezP (=R215); likely DUPLICATE or wrong locus. DROP-or-relocus.
- R179/R186 TcpB/Btp1: no VirB-translocation assay exists; keep-weak (Salcedo 2008, best-available) or drop.
- R159 MavF: lpg2391=SdbC vs MavF=lpg2351 name/locus collision; decide which protein is intended.
- R162/R163 PieE/PieF: DOI applied; CONFIRM locus (canonical lpg1969/lpg1972).

APPLY not yet run. Targets = data/gold_build/effector_gold_set.tsv (primary_ref/uniprot/locus_tag for T1-4,6) + data/dataset/positives_all.tsv (T5SS + superset). Follow script-43 pattern: backup + identity-matched edits + reversible log + quarantine for drops. Then regenerate recall_figure_proteins.tsv (script 54) + re-run citation_consistency check.

## 2026-06-16 APPLIED (script 55) + figure-table regen (script 54)

Ran scripts/55_apply_audit_corrections.py. Decisions (Teo, this session): drop R207/R208 (BopC/BopE T6SS dups), R214 (YPK_3548 dup of R215), R179/R186 (TcpB, no VirB-translocation assay); R159 MavF->SdbC (lpg2391 IS sdbC, a Dot/Icm substrate; uniprot Q5ZSX5; DOI Huang 2011); keep_current R060/R066.

Applied to data/gold_build/effector_gold_set.tsv (582->577) + data/dataset/positives_all.tsv (T5SS DOIs): 71 primary_ref + 25 uniprot + 9 locus_tag + 1 gene edits = 113 changelog entries, 5 quarantined.
Reversibility: *.pre_audit_fix.tsv backups, effector_gold_set.removed_audit.tsv (quarantine), audit_fix_changelog.tsv.

Script 54 reworked: the recall-figure table backbone is the ssign actual_per_effector tables (pre-audit identity), so it now (a) sources provenance from the corrected gold row via gold_provenance(), (b) applies the MavF->SdbC rename via a changelog-derived gene_alias, (c) excludes quarantined effectors via dropped_keys from removed_audit. Regenerated recall_figure_proteins.tsv: 245 -> 240 proteins (T4SS 42->40, T6SS 37->34). Verified: all 5 drops gone, corrected accessions/loci/DOIs surface (VopS Q87P32, SdbC, CinF Q83E23, VirE3 Vergunst2003, RipJ RSc2132, MitF lpg1976).

### STILL TODO (follow-ups)
- **Plotted figure 52 (52_system_recall.py) NOT yet regenerated.** It reads actual_per_effector + instance classification directly, independent of gold drops. The 5 dropped effectors slightly change instance-level recall; script 52 needs the same dropped_keys exclusion for the plotted figure to match the corrected answer key. (T4SS/T6SS bars affected.)
- positives_all.tsv only had its T5SS rows touched here; the T1-4,6 citation fixes were NOT mirrored into positives_all (it's the secretion-classifier-dataset training table with its own audit, script 43). If training labels should share the corrected DOIs/accessions, run a parallel sync.
- R162 PieE / R163 PieF: DOI fixed; locus left as-is (key lpg1924/lpg1959 vs canonical lpg1969/lpg1972) - confirm if it matters.
- simplify review on scripts 54/55: self-checked (55 follows script-43 pattern + bench_io; 54 edits reuse read_tsv, add one helper). Full 4-agent simplify not run (context).

## 2026-06-16 RE-AUDIT of corrected answer key (task #81) — acceptance test, STRICT bar

Method: re-audit all 240 corrected recall-figure proteins, my manual pass + 4 blind agents per batch, reconcile union. Worklists in data/phase2/verification/reaudit/ (batch_*.tsv from the regenerated recall_figure_proteins.tsv; agent{1-4}_<TYPE>.tsv; claude_<TYPE>.tsv; reconciled_<TYPE>.tsv).

USER DECISION (evidence bar): **STRICT + DROP** rows that lack a direct same-species secretion assay naming the protein (wrong-species citation, or sequence/structure/review/homology-only with no secretion assay). Keep rows with a same-species secretion-mutant/secretome assay (operon-level within the correct species/system counts as kept).

HEADLINE so far (T1SS+T2SS = 75 rows, 5 passes each): provenance 100% clean — 0 fabricated, 0 wrong accession, 0 wrong genome, 0 dead/wrong DOI. The corrected key passes the hallucination axes. The only issues are evidence-strength (the strict-drop targets).

### Running STRICT-DROP list
- T1008 cya (B. bronchiseptica): cites Glaser1988 = B. pertussis (wrong species; no bronchiseptica CyaA secretion paper exists).
- T1012 lktA (B. trehalosi): Davies2002 = lkt-operon sequence/evolution, no secretion assay.
- T1013 lktA (M. glucosida): same Davies2002, no secretion assay.
- T2042 plcB (P. aeruginosa PA0026): cited to Filloux2011 REVIEW; primary Barker2004 shows Sec secretion NOT T2SS -> possible misclassification.
- T2054 zmpA (B. cenocepacia): mic.0.26243-0 = homology-only ("likely GSP-secreted"), no T2SS-secreton-mutant assay.

### Fix-not-drop (T2SS)
- T2023 lipA (X. euvesicatoria): real Xps-T2SS substrate (JB.00322-15), but accession A0ABS8LNA2 points to a different assembly (LN463_12775) than stated XCV0536/NC_007508.1. Needs accession re-map, not a drop.

### Borderline KEPT (same-species secretome/operon evidence, strict-pass)
T1SS indirect-but-kept: T1001 Serralysin, T1003 aprA(entomophila), T1006 apxIIIA, T1015/T1016/T1017 prtA, T1018 prtB. T2SS indirect-but-kept: paeY, pelA, pelD, pelL, paAP, lasA, lapA (same-species Out/Xcp/Hxc secretome or foundational secreton paper).

### REMAINING re-audit batches: T3SS(72), T4SS(40), T5SS(19), T6SS(34) — agents not yet launched.
Then: consolidated strict-drop pass (extend script 55 pattern), regenerate figure table, final clean report.

### Re-audit (task #81) — T3SS batch done 2026-06-16
- **Agent channel BLOCKED**: all 4 blind agents (and a reframed probe) tripped the usage-policy content filter ~8 tool-calls in, on the T3SS pathogen-virulence content (plague/Yersinia/Shigella/Burkholderia). Same expected for T4/T5/T6 (intracellular pathogens). Substituted a rigorous main-session pass: every DOI resolved via crossref+europepmc, every UniProt accession resolved live, BopA row checked via PubMed. Redundancy (4 independent agents) NOT achievable for these batches by that route — user must know method deviated.
- **Provenance 100% clean** (34/34 DOIs real+on-topic T3SS papers; 49/49 UniProt accessions correct incl. held locus fixes RipJ→RSc2132, AvrA→RSc0608, PopC→RSp0875, VopS→Q87P32).
- **T3SS verdict: 54 keep / 3 drop / 15 fixable.** File: reaudit/reconciled_T3SS.tsv.
  - DROP (3): T3005 BopA (cited DOI is the TssM T6SS-DUB paper Szczesna 2024, not BopA/not T3SS; instance tag "T6SS-5" on a T3SS row — incoherent), T3013 (EXACT dup of T3011 EspA/ROD_30191), T3025 (EXACT dup of T3023 EspZ/ROD_30281).
  - FIX-not-drop (15): A/E nle/esp ortholog rows in EPEC or C.rodentium cited to a sister-species paper (mostly O157 Tobe 2006 pnas.0604891103, or the EPEC Map/NleA paper). Real verified effectors; same-species primaries exist. Rows: T3011,T3016,T3018,T3031,T3033,T3035,T3036,T3041,T3042,T3044,T3045,T3047,T3048,T3050,T3051.
- **DECISIONS PENDING (before T4/T5/T6):** (a) the 15 fixable — swap to same-species refs / accept as panel-convention / drop? (b) agent-block: accept main-session pass for remaining pathogen batches, or pause?
- Running drop list now: T1008,T1012,T1013,T2042,T2054,T3005,T3013,T3025. Fix-not-drop: T2023 lipA accession + the 15 T3SS rows above.

### Re-audit (task #81) — ALL 6 batches done 2026-06-16 (main-session pass)
HEADLINE: **provenance 100% clean across all 240 rows** — every DOI resolves to a real on-topic paper (crossref/europepmc), every UniProt accession correct (live), all prior locus/accession fixes held (RipJ→RSc2132, AvrA→RSc0608, PopC→RSp0875, VopS→Q87P32, CinF→Q83E23, MavF→SdbC, VceC→Marchesini, YezP→YPK_3549). 0 fabricated, 0 wrong-genome. All remaining issues are evidence-STRENGTH (strict bar) + a few duplicates + citation refinements.

Per-batch (reconciled_<TYPE>.tsv): provenance clean everywhere.
- T1SS 21: drop 3 (T1008,T1012,T1013). 
- T2SS 54: drop 2 (T2042,T2054); fix accession T2023 lipA.
- T3SS 72: drop 3 (T3005 BopA mis-sourced, T3013+T3025 exact dups); FIX 15 cross-species A/E orthologs (same-species refs).
- T4SS 40: drop 0; FIX 5 (T4016 Lem8 locus lpg0945->lpg1290?, T4025 PieE lpg1924->lpg1969?, T4026 PieF lpg1959->lpg1972?, T4039 VirE3 DOI is a VirE2 paper, T4007 BtpB verify translocation assay).
- T5SS 19: drop 0; FIX 1 (T5011 iga cross-species gonorrhoeae->meningitidis).
- T6SS 34: drop 1 (T6021 Tle4 = dup of T6022/PA1510); FIX T6027 TseH (bioRxiv preprint->published Altindis 2015), normalize T6002 PMID:16432199->10.1073/pnas.0510322103; VERIFY T6020 Tle3 ref + T6033 YPK_0952; DEFINITIONAL FLAG T6001/T6002 Hcp = structural tube protein but secreted (hallmark), generic gene names EFF00001/EFF00006 — user call: keep-as-secreted vs reconsider.

TOTALS: 9 drops (T1008,T1012,T1013,T2042,T2054,T3005,T3013,T3025,T6021); ~24 citation/locus/accession fixes; 3 verifies; 1 definitional flag (Hcp x2).
USER DECISIONS (this session): main-session pass OK for pathogen batches (agents blocked); FIX the 15 A/E orthologs with same-species refs (Citrobacter rows with genuinely no same-species secretion assay fall back to strict drop, flag them).
NEXT: fix-finding pass (verify+source each fix), then consolidated apply (extend script 55 quarantine+changelog pattern) for the 9 drops + fixes, regenerate recall_figure_proteins.tsv (script 54), then plotted figure 52 (task #80).

### Decision 2026-06-16: DROP Hcp rows T6001 + T6002 (user call)
Hcp is a structural T6SS tube protein (secreted as hallmark but not a cargo effector); generic gene names. User: drop both. Drop list now 11: T1008,T1012,T1013,T2042,T2054,T3005,T3013,T3025,T6021,T6001,T6002. Still open: BtpB (T4007, verifying), Citrobacter A/E orthologs (drop-vs-keep).

### BtpB resolved 2026-06-16: KEEP (not drop)
Salcedo 2013 (fcimb.2013.00028) abstract: BtpB "is a novel Brucella effector that is translocated into host cells." Same-species translocation claim present -> clears the bar TcpB/Btp1 failed (those had no translocation assay). T4007 BtpB = keep with current ref.
Citrobacter A/E orthologs: NO new decision needed — prior decisions ("fix same-species refs" + "drop thin") determine it: fix-if-same-species-assay-exists, else strict-drop. Execute as part of fix-finding.
Drop list stays 11. Correction phase = 11 drops + fix-finding (EPEC orthologs ~5 have refs; Citrobacter ~9 search-then-fix-or-drop; T4 loci x3; VirE3; T5011 iga; T6027 TseH; T2023 lipA; normalize T6002 PMID->DOI).

### Fix-finding started 2026-06-16 — checkpoint after 1 result + 1 near-miss
VERIFIED so far:
- T3047 NleE (EPEC) -> Nadler 2010 PLoS Pathog "NleE inhibits NF-kB activation" 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000743 (abstract: NleE INJECTED by EPEC into host cell = same-species translocation). GOOD FIX.
WARNING / do-not-use:
- PMID 15496394 is Mundy 2004 J Med Microbiol (espI epidemiology survey, 10.1099/jmm.0.45684-0), NOT the NleA/EspI translocation paper. The real NleA identification+translocation = Gruenheid 2004 Mol Microbiol (find correct PMID). Caught by metadata check — reaffirms: verify every PMID->paper, never trust the search-rank guess.
PENDING fix-finding (task #82): EPEC NleA(T3035), NleC(T3041), NleD(T3044), NleF(T3050); O157 Map(T3031); Citrobacter x9 (T3011 EspA,T3016 EspH,T3018 EspJ,T3033 Map,T3036 NleA,T3042 NleC,T3045 NleD,T3048 NleE,T3051 NleF) = search same-species, fix-or-strict-drop. Then task #83 (T4 loci/VirE3/iga/TseH/lipA/T6002-normalize) + task #84 (apply 11 drops + fixes, regen 54, then 52).
RECOMMEND: /compact before continuing fix-finding (precision-critical per-paper work; context heavy from full audit). All state durable here + reconciled_*.tsv.

### Fix-finding T3SS A/E orthologs COMPLETE 2026-06-16 (all 15 verified via PubMed get_article_metadata)
Every DOI below confirmed = real paper, abstract shows the claimed same-species secretion/translocation/mutant. None drop; all keep with same-species (or same-system for EspA) ref.

Citrobacter rodentium (9):
- T3011 EspA  -> Deng 2015 J Bacteriol 10.1128/JB.02401-14 (EspA/B/D translocator T3 secretion, A/E T3SS incl. C.rodentium). NOTE: secretion experiments in EPEC; C.rodentium named as same system. SYSTEM-LEVEL same-species (flag for Teo). EspA = translocon filament, in-scope (cf. EPEC EspA row T3012 kept).
- T3016 EspH  -> Mundy 2004 Infect Immun 10.1128/IAI.72.4.2288-2302.2004 (C.rodentium espH mutant, in vivo)

FLAGS for Teo (keep, but evidence is system/genetic-level not a strain-specific functional secretion assay): T3011 EspA-Cr (Deng2015 experiments are EPEC), T3045 NleD-Cr + T3048 NleE-Cr (Kelly2006 null deletions). All defensible under "operon-level same-species counts as kept"; surfacing for transparency.

Drop list UNCHANGED at 11: T1008,T1012,T1013,T2042,T2054,T3005,T3013,T3025,T6021,T6001,T6002.
Machine-readable fix table: reaudit/fixes_verified.tsv (built next). NEXT task #83: T4 loci (Lem8/PieE/PieF), VirE3 DOI, T5011 iga, T6027 TseH, T2023 lipA accession, normalize T6002 PMID->DOI, verify T6020 Tle3 + T6033 YPK_0952.

### Fix-finding T4/T5/T6 + misc COMPLETE 2026-06-16 (task #83) — all verified live
Net result: only 3 applicable fixes; several of my own re-audit flags were FALSE ALARMS (caught by verifying the actual abstracts/loci, not the search-rank guess). This is the value of the pass.

APPLY (3):
- T4016 Lem8: locus lpg0945 -> lpg1290 (+ accession -> Q5ZVZ8). Confirmed: eLife 2022 PMID 35175192 ("Lem8 (Lpg1290), 528aa Cys protease, Phldb2") + Huang 2011 (cited ref) + UniProt Q5ZVZ8 lpg1290 528aa YopT-peptidase. Row's lpg0945 = legL1 (wrong). Ref 01531.x kept.
- T6027 TseH: DOI 10.1101/868539 (bioRxiv preprint) -> 10.1128/mBio.00075-15 (Altindis 2015 mBio; "VCA0285 (TseH)...secreted by T6SS" V.cholerae). [it's mBio not PNAS]
- T2023 lipA: accession A0ABS8LNA2 -> Q3BXQ3 (reviewed LIPA_XANE5, XCV0729, 337aa secreted lipase) + locus XCV0536 -> XCV0729. A0ABS8LNA2 = LN463_12775 420aa, NOT lipA (wrong protein). Ref JB.00322-15 (Sole 2015) CONFIRMED correct: abstract names "a lipase...virulence factor" as Xps-T2S substrate.

VERIFIED-NO-CHANGE (my re-audit re-flags were wrong; current refs already correct):
- T4039 VirE3: pp.103.029223 (Vergunst 2003) DOES assay VirE3 translocation by VirB/D4 (CRAFT): "C-terminal 50 aa of VirE2 and VirE3 sufficient to mediate Cre translocation". KEEP. (My reconciled-T4SS note "it's a VirE2 paper" was WRONG.)
- T6020 Tle3: fmicb.2019.01218 (Berni 2019) DOES characterize Tle3 secretion ("secretion mechanism of Tle3...VgrG2b spike...H2-T6SS"). KEEP.
- T6033 YPK_0952: spectrum.04278-23 (Yang 2024) names "YPK_0952...effector of T6SS-3...secreted by T6SS-3...DNase". KEEP.

FLAG-NO-CHANGE (don't apply unverified locus changes that conflict with genome annotation):
- T4025 PieE, T4026 PieF: literature gives loci (mSphere 2024 "PieF (Lpg1972)"; PieE~lpg1969) but UniProt annotates lpg1972 = 125aa "Dot protein" and lpg1969 = LegC3 635aa -- CONFLICT with the genome the benchmark fetches from. Keeping current row loci (PieE=lpg1924, PieF=lpg1959); flag for Teo to reconcile against the specific assembly. Effectors are real; DOIs already fixed prior pass.
- T5011 iga (N.meningitidis MC58): keep Pohlner 1987 (325458a0) founding IgA-protease autotransporter mechanism. Cross-species (gonorrhoeae) but acceptable for a T5aSS self-secretor under the lenient T5SS bar (mechanism papers OK). van Ulsen 2001 alt is only a genome ORF survey (weaker). Flag.

### CONSOLIDATED correction set for task #84 (apply)
DROPS (11): T1008,T1012,T1013,T2042,T2054,T3005,T3013,T3025,T6021,T6001,T6002.
FIXES (18 total): 15 T3SS A/E ortholog DOIs (see prior section) + T4016 Lem8 locus/acc + T6027 TseH DOI + T2023 lipA acc/locus.
Build reaudit/fixes_verified.tsv next, then extend script 55 pattern -> apply -> regen script 54 -> regen figure 52 (task #80).

### APPLIED re-audit corrections (task #84) + figure regen + plotted-figure regen (task #80) — 2026-06-16
Scripts: 56_apply_reaudit_corrections.py (gold), edits to 54 (figure table) + 52 (plotted instance-recall).

CAUGHT A MIS-DROP before it shipped: first run of script 56 used script-55's locate() which pre-filters by
ss_type. The batch file tags T3005 BopA as T3SS, but the incoherent BopA gold row is ss_type=T6SS (locus
BTH_II0876); meanwhile a LEGIT B.pseudomallei T3SS BopA (Q63K42/BPSS1524) also exists. locate() matched and
dropped the LEGIT one. Reverted (git-clean: gold was uncommitted working-tree, removed_audit untracked;
restored from pre_reaudit2 backup), rewrote script 56 matching to GENOME identity (gene+locus/uniprot, ss_type
NOT used) + organism-mismatch guard + grouped multi-field fixes. Re-ran: correct BopA (B.thailandensis T6SS)
dropped, B.pseudomallei kept. Audited all 27 applications: every T3SS DOI landed on the right species row.

Gold: 577 -> 568 (9 quarantined). Field edits: 16 primary_ref + 2 locus_tag + 2 uniprot = 20.
Reversibility: effector_gold_set.pre_reaudit2.tsv (backup), effector_gold_set.removed_reaudit2.tsv (9 drops),
audit_fix_changelog_reaudit2.tsv (29 entries). removed_audit.tsv left at round-1 (5 rows); script 54/52 read BOTH.

Script 54 changes: (a) dropped_keys -> dropped_id keyed by genome identity (gene,uniprot)+(gene,locus), NOT
(ss_type,gene) -- required because cya (B.bronchiseptica drop vs B.pertussis keep) and lktA (drop 2 of 4 hosts)
share a gene; coarse key would over-drop. Reads removed_audit + removed_reaudit2. (b) instance-dedup: collapse
same (ss,gene,locus,organism) keeping 'found' over 'unreach' -> removes the 2 EspA/EspZ-Cr T3SS_28 dup rows
(logged, not silent).
recall_figure_proteins.tsv: 240 -> 230 (8 drops-in-figure + 2 dedup; BopA-thai wasn't in figure so its gold
drop removes 0 figure rows). Per-type: T1SS 18, T2SS 52, T3SS 70, T4SS 40, T5SS 19, T6SS 31.

Script 52 (plotted instance-recall 06_recall_systems.png): added same dropped_id filter (dedup N/A at instance
level). Instance-recall before->after audit drops (excl T5SS): found 36/46 -> 33/43 reachable. Deltas: T1SS
testable 21->18 (cya-Bb + lktA x2 were singleton-effector instances; recall RATE unchanged 100%), T2SS 12->11,
T4SS 10->9 (round-1 TcpB/Btp1). T3SS/T6SS unchanged (dropped effectors shared instances or were instance-less).
Final plotted: ssign found 48/60 reachable systems (incl T5SS 15/17).

TASK #81 ACCEPTANCE TEST RESULT: provenance 100% clean across all 240 (0 fabricated/wrong-genome/dead-DOI);
strict-bar corrections = 11 drops + 18 verified fixes, all applied + propagated. Re-audit COMPLETE.
Open flags for Teo (keep, low-priority): T3011 EspA-Cr (Deng2015 system-level), T3045/T3048 NleD/E-Cr (Kelly2006
genetic), T4025/T4026 PieE/PieF loci (lit vs UniProt annotation conflict), T5011 iga (cross-species mechanism).
