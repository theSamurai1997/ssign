"""Map original GenBank CDS annotations onto Bakta's fresh CDS predictions.

Phase 3.3 re-annotates every input with Bakta by default, including
GenBank files. That gives uniform Bakta-produced annotations across a
cohort, but the user's original GenBank annotations (from whatever
pipeline produced their file) would otherwise be lost — Bakta assigns
its own locus tags and may shift CDS boundaries a few bp in either
direction, so a naive locus-tag join loses the mapping.

This script bridges the two: for each Bakta CDS, find the GenBank CDS
with the largest reciprocal coordinate overlap (above a threshold),
and carry the GenBank's `product` across as `gbff_annotation`. Bakta
CDS with no sufficiently-overlapping GenBank CDS get an empty
`gbff_annotation`. The result feeds annotation-consensus voting as a
third opinion alongside Bakta's own product and EggNOG's description.

Input TSVs expected:
    --bakta-gene-info       Bakta's gene_info.tsv (from run_bakta.py)
    --genbank-gene-info     Original GenBank's gene_info.tsv (from
                            extract_proteins.py's --out-gene-info)

Both have columns locus_tag, contig, start (0-based), end, strand, product.

Output: the Bakta gene_info.tsv with an added `gbff_annotation` column.
