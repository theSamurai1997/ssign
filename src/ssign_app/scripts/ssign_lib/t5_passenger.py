"""Build a passenger-substituted FASTA for T5aSS annotation routing.

The annotation tools that default to passenger-only for T5aSS substrates
(EggNOG / BLASTp / pLM-BLAST / HHsearch / ProtParam) read their input
sequences from a single FASTA keyed by locus_tag. To route the passenger
domain through those tools without changing each wrapper's contract, we
build one FASTA where T5aSS substrates carry their passenger subsequence
under the same locus_tag, and every other entry carries the full protein
unchanged. The wrappers see a normal locus_tag-keyed FASTA.

Routing rules (per T5aSS substrate):
- t5_quality_flag is non-empty (barrel_only, no_signalp, no_sec_signal,
  omp_porin_no_at, unclassified) → fall back to full protein.
- passenger_length < MIN_PASSENGER_FOR_ANNOTATION → fall back to full.
- Otherwise → write the passenger subsequence
  seq[sp_end : barrel_start - LINKER_LENGTH]  (0-indexed slice).

Non-T5aSS substrates and proteins absent from the classifications TSV
are written with their full sequence.

Side-car TSV records, per locus_tag, whether the FASTA entry is the
passenger or the full protein; integrate_annotations.py uses this to
populate the t5_annotation_source column in the master CSV.
