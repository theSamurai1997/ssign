# Max protein length DeepLocPro will be asked to embed. Its ESM-style transformer

# DeepLocPro is a core step, crashes the whole genome. The motivating case:
# plu2670 / kolossin synthetase = 16,367 aa, the largest known prokaryotic protein
# (UniProt Q7N3P5). Sequences longer than this are withheld from the model and
# marked "not predicted" — they are cytoplasmic NRPS/PKS megasynthases and giant
# assembly lines, not secretion substrates. Override with SSIGN_DEEPLOCPRO_MAX_AA.

# --- Tool subprocess timeout ---
# Generic upper bound for any external bioinformatics tool ssign shells
# out to (BLAST, IPS, EggNOG, Bakta, pLM-BLAST, DLP, SignalP). 4h is
# deliberately generous — pathological inputs (giant proteome, huge DB,
# slow disk) can stretch any of these tools well past the typical
# 10-60 min runtime. A timeout firing means the tool is wedged or the
# input is unrealistically large; give up rather than block the rest of
# the pipeline forever. Bump if you see legitimate timeouts.
# (HH-suite has its own per-stage timeouts a few sections below — those
# are tighter because they fire per-protein, not per-batch.)

# --- pLM-BLAST ---
# Per-batch timeout for the embedding + search subprocesses. pLM-BLAST
# scales roughly linearly with query count at fixed cpc — empirically on
# CX3 RTX6000 ~17 s per query at cpc=90, so a 184-substrate pooled run
# (4-genome batched) takes ~50 min and a single PAO1 with ~92 substrates
# took 85 min on 2026-06-04. A T1SS-rich or larger-N genome could push
# over the 4 h generic TOOL_TIMEOUT_S, so this step gets its own 24 h cap.
# If you see a real timeout: increase substrate filtering (--conf-threshold)
# or split the run into smaller batches; don't keep bumping the cap.

# the user is explicit.
#
# Mapping reflects "what does this tier ship that's also actually usable?":
#   - base: Bakta light DB + DeepSecE/PLM-Effector weights → those tools
#     default on. Annotation tools that need extended DBs (EggNOG ~50 GB,
#     IPS ~24 GB, ECOD30 ~11 GB) default off.
#   - extended: adds those three DBs → EggNOG/IPS/pLM-BLAST default on.
#     Pfam + PDB70 also get fetched, but HH-suite stays default-off (see
#     _EXTENDED_ADDS comment) until the wrapper degrades gracefully
#     without UniRef30.
#   - full: adds BLAST NR (390 GB) + HH-suite UniRef30 → BLASTp and
#     HH-suite default on at the full tier.
#
# `run_bakta` is governed by --use-input-annotations + Bakta-DB-present
# invariant separately; not in this table.
# Each tool listed exactly once at the tier it first becomes available.
# The full per-tier on/off map is built below.

# the PLM-E over-prediction memo). Opt in with --no-skip-plm-effector. Listed here (not

# thinking HH-suite is available when it can't actually run. Pfam +

# HH-suite manually (--no-skip-hhsuite) on a node with UniRef30 present.
