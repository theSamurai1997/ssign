"""Per-tool effort model: machine-agnostic runtime in reference-machine seconds.

`effort(tool, size, regime)` returns how long a tool *would* take on the
reference machine (CX3-A40, rate 1.0). The online estimator divides this by the
inferred per-machine rate to get a real ETA (see `estimator.py`).

Coefficients are fit offline from cleaned calibration data and bundled as
`coefficients.json` (regenerate with `calibration/fit.py`). This module only
*reads* them; it has no dependency on the calibration data or numpy.
