"""Online ETA estimator: project a run's remaining time, tightening as it goes.

The machine's speed is unknown at run start, so the estimate begins as a wide
prior built from machine-agnostic effort (effort_model) at the reference rate,
then infers this machine's cpu/gpu/io rate from each completed tool and
re-projects the rest.

A *plan* is the ordered list of stages a run will execute. A stage is a list of
Steps that run concurrently (e.g. the DLP/DSE/SignalP predictor block); stages
run serially. A stage's wall-clock is gated by its slowest member, so the ETA
sums the per-stage maxima.

This module is pipeline-agnostic: it takes a plan and completion events. Building
the plan from a live PipelineRunner (or replaying a finished run) is the caller's
job — see calibration/replay.py for the replay path.
