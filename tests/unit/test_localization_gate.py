"""Unit tests for the literature-derived localization-correctness gate.

Covers the helper in ``ssign_lib.localization_gate``: TSV loading,
per-system scoring, and ss_type aggregation. The shipped TSV under
``ssign_lib/data/`` is also smoke-tested for shape and DLP-vocab
validity since the gate is only as good as the table behind it.
